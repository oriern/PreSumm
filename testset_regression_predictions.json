Called the\u00a0Michigan Micro Mote, to tiny technology is a complete computer system. Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor, and give everyday objects computing capabilities. The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world, measuring less than 2mm across. The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. By strobing light at a high frequency, the operator is able to send information to the computer. Once the Micro Mote processes the data, it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies. The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete, operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across. 'To be 'complete,' a computer system must have an input of data, the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it, make decisions about what to do next \u2013 and ultimately, the ability to output the data.' Professor David\u00a0Blaauw explained. 'The sensors are the input and the radios are the output. The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power.' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems. A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008. The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915\u00b5m2, and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW. (Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell.) Blaauw explained why Phoenix's extreme energy efficiency is so important: 'As you shrink down in size, the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery. 'It's actually not hard to make chips small, but it is hard to make them low power. 'We could have very small chips, but we'd still end up with really large batteries.' This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information, its inventors say. The solar system allows the computer to work \u00a0under indoor lights without ever having to be charged. 'With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW, the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually,' the team say. The device's standby power consumption is 2nA. That's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby, or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field. There are currently three different systems in the M3 family, focusing on several different applications: sensing temperature, pressure, and taking images. 'Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another,' says Blaauw, 'and we're currently working to extend their range to about 20m.' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information. Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home, business, or personal device. 'We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices, and that's why we went with the modular or stacked approach.' Blaauw explained. 'It's the key aspect of our design. If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys.'", "label": 0.4583333333333333, "predicted": 0.6099569797515869}, "2": {"text": "(CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV's \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard's\" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his \"hot pursuit\" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\" \"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\" But Best will always be best known for his \"Hazzard\" role, which lives on in reruns. \"Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,\" Latshaw said. \"I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.\" People we've lost in 2015 .

Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he\u2019s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn\u2019t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production.\u00a0The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the\u00a0trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on\u00a0CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads.

An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday . \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club . He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019", "label": 0.4285714427630107, "predicted": 0.6063109636306763}, "5": {"text": "Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades . Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.'

The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. Department of Energy\u00a0figures state that the average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. According to that figure, a single, fully-charged Powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home's energy needs on any given day. However, it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings, when homes use the vast majority of their electricity. Musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy. The system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home, rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced, then buy it again during peak times. It could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. According to tech site Mashable, Musk told attendees at the event: 'Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy. Pictured is a utility-scale version of Powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power . The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage . Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the big brother of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. 'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. 'It sounds crazy, but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon.' As well as the daily-use model, Tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt-hour backup battery, designed to tide homes over during power blackouts, such as those caused by storms. Marketing material for the device, published late Thursday on Tesla's website, says: 'Powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening. 'It also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply. 'Automated, compact and simple to install, Powerwall offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup.' Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck'.

The latest announcement builds on previous Tesla products, principally its range of cars. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this.

'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. Deutsche Bank estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in Nevada. Stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil-fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof, generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a Tesla Model S sedan parked in the garage. Government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business. Tesla has so far received $1.1 million from California's Self-Generation Incentive Program.

It contains molecules of nano-molecular keratin to penetrate deep within each strand, creating long-lasting results. Finally, her hair was blow-dried. THE VERDICT: 'I love my new look,' says Deborah.

His wife threw all his shirts outside, but he followed her and shouted at her before he pulled her hair and punched her several times in the face. Neighbours called the police after Bulman drove away, damaging a gate post and a van, leaving his frightened wife with a black eye and a lump on her head.

Recorder Jim Tindal also ordered Bulman to complete rehabilitation and programme requirements, and not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife. He said: 'As a result of an argument in which things were said on both sides you lost your temper, you lost control and you behaved appallingly.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was encouraged by two aides to charge the Labour peer with historic sex crimes. Both Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Scroll down for video . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders 'ignored the advice' of to top QCs to charge Lord Janner . Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse werer made . In particular Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided that it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his advanced Alzheimer\u2019s, sparking a storm of controversy. The latest revelation came as Mrs Saunders endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claims against Janner whatever his mental state. Figures from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fears of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concerns were justified. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something \u2018very strange\u2019 about the decision and Health Minster Norman Lamb called for the matter to be settled by the courts. Accusing the CPS of \u2018heinous errors\u2019, Mr Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial. \u2018My concern is that because the DPP and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service at a local level have made errors in this case, heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so,\u2019 he said. \u2018This matter should not be concluded by the DPP and should be brought before a court. \u2018There is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial. With allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach.\u2019 Mr Hunt said Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been \u2018right\u2019 to express concern at the decision. \u2018I think she\u2019s right to do so and I think Boris is right to do so as well because I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious,\u2019 he said. Meanwhile Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and leading legal expert, said that although there was strong evidence that Lord Janner was suffering from dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. Earlier this week, leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute Lord Janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. The cross-party group, led by Labour\u2019s Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times saying: \u2018As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.\u2019 Mrs Saunders announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so. Mrs Saunders\u2019 decision not to prosecute came after a two-year multi-million pound inquiry by Leicestershire Police examining allegations spanning four decades. It led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a High Court legal challenge. Mrs Saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular. But the Daily Mail can reveal Clare Montgomery QC offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Mayor of London Boris Johson, pictured, has expressed concern over the failure to charge Lord Janner . She told Mrs Saunders it was unlikely prosecutors would be \u2018susceptible\u2019 to a judicial review if she took Janner to court. Senior lawyers feared Janner\u2019s legal team, closely advised by his QC son Daniel, would try and block the case with a High Court challenge focusing on his ill health. But Mrs Montgomery is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful. Eleanor Laws QC, who was leading counsel to the investigation, recommended that he be charged. Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. Mrs Saunders concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but Janner\u2019s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings. She appointed two of the country\u2019s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve. They were Professor Michael Kopelman, of King\u2019s College London, and Dr Katherine Humphreys, of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. At least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including six in the past year. Mrs Saunders has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the Janner row. One said: \u2018She says she will not be hounded out of office. She is absolutely determined to stay in post.\u2019 In the coming months, she is due to rule on whether Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the News of the World. Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and said Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an \u2018ancillary matter\u2019. She said: \u2018It is the Director of Public Prosecution\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what she has done in this case. \u2018As the ultimate decision maker, she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based, ultimately, on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case, no one else\u2019s.\u2019", "label": 0.34375, "predicted": 0.6110376715660095}, "12": {"text": "Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women.

Angry neighbours have even left notes on her front door saying 'keep your devil dog away', she says. One postman on his rounds reported Winston bounded 100 yards up the street towards him before clamping his powerful teeth around his mailbag. The victim had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. A second postmen reported being being bitten on the arm and had to kick Winston in the head twice to fend him off. Winston's attacks have led to a 14 month ban on all postal deliveries to 60 homes in his neighbourhood. Residents living on two surrounding roads  have been making make a four-and-a-half mile round trips, sometimes by taxi, to collect their mail. Twin Valley Homes housing association has now taken Miss Sandiford, 30, to court and she must find a new home for the dog by 4pm on April 30 or her tenancy is at risk. Obsessed: Miss Sandiford admits her American bulldog has 'a thing' for chewing up mail - but unfortunately this has led to him also attacking postal staff . Legal battle: A housing association has decided to end a ban on postal deliveries to the area of Blackburn by demanding that Winston is evicted . The ruling at Preston County Court means the post to the area is due to resume on May 1. Today Miss Sandiford, who has asked a friend to take in Winston, said: 'I feel sick and gutted to be losing Winston. Winston had been brilliant and I have done everything they asked me to do but they're still making a big deal out of it. Court case: Miss Sandiford outside court last year after Winston was threatened with destruction for attacking a postie . 'I have had things stuck on my door saying keep my 'devil dog' away. I don't even like going out anymore I'm not the same kind of person. My kids have been affected at school through it because people would say stuff and my son gets into trouble because of that. We are being taunted all the time. 'Winston is one of the nicest dogs. He is not a danger - I wouldn't have him near my kids. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves. I don't get much post only bills and a lot of junk mail and he loves ripping them up. He doesn't touch the kids toys he'd rather play with the leaflets that come through the door. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.' Winston's first trouble came in February last year after it bit an unnamed postman on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by his owner's nine-year-old son. The postman suffered a bite wound which broke his skin and he underwent medical treatment in hospital. Although postal deliveries were suspended no action was initially taken against the animal but at 10am on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog bounded up to postman Paul Warnock whilst he was on his rounds. Mr Warnock who had only delivered to only a handful of houses later told a court hearing: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog. As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' Keen: Winston once ran 100 yards to get to a post bag and the postman only managed to dive into a garden because he tossed a letter into the middle of the road . 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted \"Get back get back, dog loose on the street!\".' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Last October Miss Sandiford pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She was also told that whenever is taken out for walks, he must be muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads and has to be accompanied by a person over the age of 16. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced, but now it appears she must part with Winston to keep her home. David King, one of Miss Sadiford's neighbours said: 'It's brilliant news if they are going to start up the deliveries again. We've waited a long time to get the mail back. My wife is disabled and having to go down to the depot every time we get a letter is hugely frustrating. It's also frustrating that it has taken so long for this to be sorted. Trevor Smith said: 'The Royal Mail could have handled this a lot better and sorted it sooner. I can't understand why they stopped delivering to so many houses anyway. I'm not happy about it. I'll believe the deliveries are restarting when I see it.' Ian Bell, head of Twin Valley Homes, said: 'We're delighted to get this result. The people in the area have suffered due to a lack of a postal service and being in fear of this dog for too long, but now they can see an end in sight. The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers and we are pleased with this outcome.'", "label": 0.4523809601863225, "predicted": 0.5506834983825684}, "17": {"text": "David Cameron has suggested using jujitsu to 'put Nigel Farage on the floor' in tonight's televised debate between seven party leaders.

All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test . But later he played down the idea of physical violence, telling reporters: 'It was a joke. There'll be no bodily contact tonight.' Today Mr Cameron insisted he was not nervous and was 'relishing' the prospect of the two-hour debate in the ITV studios at Salford's MediaCityUK. Mr Cameron told reporters: 'It is a chance to get across that we have a long-term economic plan that is working.' For his part, Mr Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test, telling Sky News: 'I hope the truth comes out on some issues. 'Particularly, I shall be arguing and asking the Prime Minister and others, will they please admit that, as members of the EU, we cannot have an immigration policy of any kind at all.'

It is the only time Mr Cameron will go up against Mr Miliband, with one of them certain to be Prime Minister after May 7.

With all the polls pointing to an extremely tight contest, the leaders of the two biggest parties will be anxious to avoid any costly slips while looking for the opportunity to score points at expense of their rival.

The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people.

The list of don'ts runs to several dozen items. More than 20 other states have such lists. But, the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov. Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive, according to state Department for Children and Families officials. The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four. To qualify that family must have an annual household income below $31,525 - before taxes - and assets valued at less than $2,000. Cutting back: In this April 13 photo, Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas . The new restrictions, regarding Kansas applicants, have inspired national criticism and mockery from The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart suggested that in accepting federal funds, Kansas should be forced to give up items like roads 'paved with luxurious asphalt.' 'The list has attracted attention because it feels mean-spirited,' said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children. 'It really seems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.' It is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July that Brownback and his allies say is aimed at moving poor families from social services into jobs. In Kansas, here\u2019s a list of what would be forbidden to those using cash assisted funds: . 'We want to get people off of public assistance and into private-sector employment, and we've had a lot of success with that,' Brownback during an interview this week with The Associated Press. A 2012 federal law requires states to prevent benefit-card use at liquor stores, gambling establishments or adult-entertainment businesses. At least 23 states have their own restrictions on how cards can be used, mostly for alcohol, tobacco, gambling and adult-oriented businesses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states - not Kansas - prohibit buying guns, according to the NCSL, and a few ban tattoos or body piercings. Massachusetts prohibits spending on jewelry, bail bonds, or 'vacation services.' A 2014 Louisiana law bars card use on cruise ships, which is also on the Kansas list. Kansas Department for Children and Families officials said that it's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash. The law will limit ATM withdrawals of cash assistance to $25 a day. The department said it reclaimed $199,000 in cash assistance from 81 fraud cases from July through February, but said most involved questions about eligibility. The state provided $14 million in cash assistance during the same period. A 2014 federal report said a check of eight states' data showed transactions with benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos or strip clubs accounted for less than 1 percent of the total. Critics question whether such restrictions can be enforced. Elizabeth Schott, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said enacting them simply creates an 'aura of abuse.' 'Undermining support for the programs is what the restrictions do,' she said. Phyllis Gilmore, Kansas secretary for children and families, said her state's list is a 'composite' of others and has educational value, sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities. 'Every dollar that is used fraudulently is a dollar that is not going to an American who is struggling,' said state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican who supported the bill. Helping hand: The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four . Much of the new Kansas law codifies administrative policies enacted after Brownback took office in January 2011, so they'll be harder to undo later. They include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week, be looking for work or enroll in job training. The new law also includes a much-criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months, although the state Department for Children and Families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit. The number of cash assistance recipients in Kansas has dropped 63per cent since Brownback took office, to about 14,700 in February. Brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies, but critics note that U.S. Census Bureau figures show the state's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013. Brownback said his state's list of prohibited cash-assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare-to-work policies. 'I think you're seeing the left trying to pillory this,' Brownback said. 'They're just trying to poke fun at it, when it's not what the debate is really about.'", "label": 0.3796296361833811, "predicted": 0.515011727809906}, "21": {"text": "Known for their high-end boutiques, wallet-stretching gastronomical delights, and luxurious hotel offerings, it may seem like an impossible dream to visit some of the world's most cosmopolitan cities on a budget.

And those who are planning on travelling out before this date with existing bookings have been offered a full refund or alternative trip. Scroll down for video . As the search goes on for those missing in the earthquake, the British Foreign Office has advised tourists in Nepal to follow the advice from local authorities . The company confirmed to MailOnline Travel that their 200 clients who are currently in the country have all been accounted for and are safe. 'While we are continuing to concentrate on the safety of our clients out in Nepal, we have decided to cancel all our trips to the country until May 11 while the rescue operation is underway,' said a spokesperson. 'Safety is our main priority, and even after this date, we may have to recommend our customers to book to visit somewhere else. 'No-one knows how long the rescue operation will go on for, but in the short term we wouldn't advise anyone to visit after such a disaster.' Intrepid Group has been running tours to Nepal for 36 years and has a team of local operators on the ground constantly monitoring the situation. Nepal\u2019s capital Kathmandu \u2013 with a population of over one million \u2013 was one of the worst-hit areas in Nepal, with the quake\u2019s epicentre just 50 miles north of the city. As the tremors intensified, people were seen in scenes of mayhem running from their homes and places of work in panic. Dozens of people were gathered in the car park of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pyjamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. Around 1,000 tourists have amassed at\u00a0Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu in the hope of getting out of Nepal following the earthquake . Jordan Torrilla, Nepal expert with luxury holiday company Kuoni has warned tourists what they should expect if they honour their trips to the Asian country. 'As with any aftermath of a natural disaster, there will be a frenzy, and it certainly won't be calm and tranquil',' he told MailOnline Travel. 'There will be an atmosphere of worry, people will be doing emergency shopping, and obviously it wouldn't be a great time to be going out there. 'There are always times when people have to travel out to these destinations after a disaster, tourists just have to be aware of the people and what they will be going through. 'You are certainly not going to be number one, not going to be the priority. It's important you have a deep level of patience as it will be very difficult for the local to prioritise you when they may be dealing with severe family issues and loss of life.' And a spokesperson for Trailfinders confirmed that their customers scheduled to travel to Nepal in the next couple of days have been contacted and advised against making the trip. All 12 bookings they have out in Nepal have been accounted for and plans are being made to return them home. People survey the rubble of damaged buildings a day after a massive earthquake in Nepal . Meanwhile the Foreign Office advice is that British tourists should check with their travel provider before heading to Nepal. The importance of following local authorities' advice as well as keeping an eye on news and updates has also been highlighted as critical for anyone who may have been caught up in the disaster. And the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) told MailOnline Travel that tourists should be aware that Nepal is always considered a country of 'high-risk' of earthquake, and that their main focus is on helping Britons caught up in the disaster. 'We advise people to stay in a place of safety and follow any advice provided by local authorities,' a spokesperson said. 'The situation is always changing, so it's important to keep an eye on local news providers. 'Our general advice to anyone who is set to travel, or currently travelling, out there would be to check with your travel provider, and to make sure you keep abreast of the situation. 'We have a dedicated phone number that people can call if they have any questions at all about the situation, and this can be about outward travel too.' The earthquake's epicentre was Kathmandu, but aftershocks and tremors have been felt in another three countries . The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes. The 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. Television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu has re-opened following the disaster, but with over a thousand people queuing overnight, the journey out of Nepal will be problematic for tourists. NDTV reports that a queue 'perhaps a kilometre long' has grown outside Nepal's only international airport, with many families having to go without food and water in the hope of leaving the country. A statement on the FCO website reads: 'The British Embassy would seek to help British nationals to leave as soon as possible following a major natural disaster. Around 2,000 people are thought to have died in Nepal alone, with hundred still missing . 'However, Kathmandu\u2019s Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be unusable following a large-scale earthquake, as will Nepal\u2019s road network. It could take some days for it to become operational.' A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) told MailOnline Travel: 'Travellers in Nepal are advised to monitor local news and media reports and to follow any advice and instructions issued by the authorities and by the Foreign Office. 'ABTA works closely with its Members and with the Foreign Office to ensure the safety of any customers and staff affected. 'British travellers in Nepal or those due to travel should contact their holiday company who will help them with any concerns.' Nepalese rescue members and onlookers gather at the collapsed Darahara Tower in Kathmandu; tourists are now making their way to\u00a0Tribhuvan International Airport in the hope of avoiding another disaster . Around 40,000 British Nationals are reported to have visited Nepal in 2013. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond has said his thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the natural disaster, and that the British government are in 'close contact' with their Nepalese counterparts. 'The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals,' he added. This morning, a 6.7 magnitude aftershock struck India and Nepal, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas. The earthquake also triggered a massive avalanche on Mount Everest killing 18 people and injuring at least 30 climbers.

The Prime Minister visited a primary school near Bolton to unveil the party's latest proposal to improve education standards, after announcing that under a future Tory government children who achieve poor SATs results will be forced to resit them in secondary school. As Mr Cameron tried to help school pupil Lucy Howarth read a story about 'Prince Ronald' the youngster pulled a series of funny faces before resting her head on the table after struggling with a tricky passage. Scroll down for video . David Cameron helps with a reading lesson with pupils Lucy Howarth, 6, and Will Spibey, 5, left, during a visit to Sacred Heart RC primary school in Westhoughton near Bolton today . The PM wants to see children who get poor Sats results  forced to resit them in secondary school . The Prime Minister shared a joke  with six-year-old Lucy at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . The Prime Minister appeared completely taken with the youngster who showed no signs of being fazed by his attendance. Mr Cameron had planned to use the classroom visit to unveil his plan, which he said was intended to inject 'more rigour and zero tolerance of failure and mediocrity' in schools. The resit plan would mean 100,000 pupils taking a new test in English and maths during their first year after leaving primary school. The proposal would be implemented next year and is aimed at making sure that pupils have not already fallen too far behind at the beginning of secondary school. Pupils who did not get good grades in the Sats tests taken by 11-year-olds in primary school would have to retake a test during their first year after moving up to secondary school. In last year's tests, 79 per cent of pupils achieved the expected grades in reading, writing and maths. The Tories claim that, too often, pupils who have slipped behind by this stage never catch up. Among those who fail to make the grade at the age of 11, they say only 7% go on to get five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Children would be forced to retake a test in maths and English, marked by teachers rather than external examiners. There could be up to two retakes, in the spring or summer terms, and the number of pupils who had failed the retakes would be published as part of the league table data. The PM made the announcement in Lancashire today with the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (centre) Mr Cameron  chatted with  pupils outside at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . Pupils with special needs would not have to take the resits. Mr Cameron said: 'There is no job that doesn't require English and maths, and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan added: 'We know that the biggest predictor of success at GCSE is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11. That means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they'll struggle for the rest of their time in education.' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt dismissed the proposal as 'desperate' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said dismissed the announcement as a 'a desperate attempt by the Tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards'. Mr Hunt said: 'On their watch, 1.6 million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than 'good' by Ofsted. And as a result of David Cameron's unqualified teachers policy, more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers. 'Labour has a better plan for education. We will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new master teacher status to raise the standing of the profession. That is how we improve education for every child, in every classroom,' he said. The Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws said the Tories had 'no credibility' on education because of their planned spending cuts after the election. He said: ' You simply can't improve schools by starving them of resources and burdening them with the bureaucracy of additional testing. 'The way to make sure every child starts secondary school achieving a good level of Maths and English is to invest in their early years and primary education, recruiting great teachers and getting extra support to the children who most need it. 'That's why we need to protect the education budget, in real terms, including schools, nurseries and colleges. 'The Tories are trying to paper over the cracks in their scorched earth education plans that would undo the progress of the last five years.' Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, warned the tests could become a bureaucratic nightmare. He said: 'It is important that the results of these tests are diagnostic and used to support the work of the teachers and do not become yet another performance indicator on which to measure schools.'", "label": 0.38333334649602574, "predicted": 0.5765244960784912}, "24": {"text": "A Seattle-based filmmaker who spent three months in Thailand has created the ultimate love letter to some of the country\u2019s best beauty spots.

The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury.

It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. \"We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,\" said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. \"Many people are crying, sharing their hardships,\" he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. \"This is not the time to rest and lament,\" he said. \"This is the time to go out and save lives.\" Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. \"Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,\" he said. \"We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves.\" Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. \"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,\" he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. \"We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,\" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. \"We cannot say by how much exactly.\" The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was \"on a war footing\" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. \"The biggest problem is reaching these villages,\" Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. \"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,\" he said. \"We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them.\" Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs \"huge and urgent.\" \"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,\" he said. \"I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed.\" A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. \"Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,\" Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain.

US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants, which could boost plants\u2019 yields and the income of farmers. A gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, scientists claim. \u00a0A stock image of chocolates is shown . More than five million cocoa farmers and their families depend on cocoa for their livelihoods around the world, where Cacao, Theobroma cacao L is cultivated in West Africa, Central and South America. The World Cocoa Foundation puts annual cocoa production worldwide at 3.8 million tons, which is valued at $11.8 billion (\u00a37.9 billion). Each cocoa pod has 40 seeds, which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate \u2013 and some drugs. Lead researcher Mark Guiltinan, professor of plant molecular biology at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

The world's largest confectionary producer, joined Mars in November in warning of a massive shortfall of chocolate, which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020. Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group said soaring demand has helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago. Industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades. Cocoa prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in August of \u00a32,000 a tonne, nearing a February 2011 peak, Barry Callebaut said. Before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above \u00a31,300, according to figures from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Barry Callebaut chief executive Juergen Steinemann said the hike was fuelled partly by a 'potential cocoa shortage' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by Mars Chocolate that demand will outstrip supply. 'The global cocoa sector may suffer a one million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world,' the firm said. 'Our long-term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa, and we believe that securing cocoa\u2019s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers.' Disease and drought are partly to blame, but countries are also eating more sweets, particularly developing nations such as China. For example, a chocolate with a higher or lower melting point would be useful for production of chocolate with specific textures and specialty applications. 'The \"snap\" and \"melt\" of chocolate are two very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers, and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,\u2019 Professor Guiltinan explained. \u2018Medical applications could include production of drug-delivery products with slower release of drugs than is possible with current cocoa-butter-based systems.\u2019 Professor Guiltinan was previously involved in research that first described the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) gene family in the cocoa tree. Collaborators from the International Cocoa Genome Consortium sequenced the genome of the plant. Now Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 \u2013 in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. \u2018We used state-of-the-art plant science techniques to gain evidence for the role of the SAD1 gene in cocoa butter biosynthesis,\u2019 he explained. \u2018The other SAD genes appear to play other roles in the growth of the chocolate tree, such as flower and leaf development, where these fatty acids play important roles as key components of various membrane systems. \u2018This information can be used to develop biomarkers for screening and breeding of new cacao varieties with novel fatty acid compositions of cocoa butter.\u2019 This image shows cacao seeds after harvest. A mixture of lipids called cocoa butter makes up about half of each seed. The natural melting point of cocoa butter is close to human body temperature. This trait gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture and provides a creamy texture to lotions applied to the skin . Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 \u2013 in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. He said the discovery could lead to new types of chocolate, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. A cocoa butter body scrub is shown left and a stock image of drugs, right . Cocoa butter consists of almost equal amounts of palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Its exact composition determines its melting temperature, which is very close to human body temperature. This is why chocolate feels smooth in the mouth and cosmetics containing cocoa butter have a creamy texture when applied to skin. \u2018During cacao seed development, large amounts of fatty acids are synthesised that are rich in saturated and monounsaturated lipids,\u2019 Professor Guiltinan said. \u2018An important part of this process is the activity of an enzyme produced by the SAD1 gene that creates a special double bond critical in determining the melting point of chocolate that is\u00a0very close to the human body temperature and makes cocoa butter quite unique.\u2019 'The \"snap\" and \"melt\" of chocolate are very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers (stock image), and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,\u2019 Prof Guiltinan said .", "label": 0.5092592760920525, "predicted": 0.583976149559021}, "31": {"text": "An alleged 'serial bride' accused of running a wife-for-hire immigration scheme was arrested just after leaving court Friday, when she allegedly evaded the fare at a Bronx subway station. 38-year-old Liana Barrientos pleaded not guilty on Friday based on charges that she married 10 men over 11 years and charged a fee for her 'services'.

After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post.

But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar.

Eyesight and colour was recently linked to how we perceive the world by Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus. He explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can\u2019t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. \u2018Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we\u2019d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. \u2018Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,\u2019 he continued. The blue and black (or gold and white) dress that sweeped the internet last month revealed just how differently two people can see the world. But it's not just about lighting conditions or optical illusions - evidence is mounting that until we have a way to describe something, we may not see its there. Ancient languages, for instance, didn't have a word for blue and scientists believe as a result our ancestors didn't notice the colour even existed. In 1858 William Gladstone, who later became the British prime minister, counted the colour references in the Homer's Odyssey and found blue wasn't mentioned at all. Black is mentioned nearly 200 times and white about 100. Red, meanwhile, is mentioned fewer than 15 times, and yellow and green fewer than 10. And blue doesn't appear in Greek texts, the Koran, ancient Chinese stories, and an ancient Hebrew version of the Bible, according to a German philologist named Lazarus Geiger. Egyptians, who were the only culture that could produce blue dyes, were the first ancient civilisation to have a word for the colour blue and there remain tribes today who don't have a word for blue, such as the Himba people in Namibia. Several years ago, researchers showed some of the Himba tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one blue. The study found they could not pick out which one was different from the others, or took much longer to make sense of it. However, the same tribe has many different words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they could pick it out immediately. Researchers showed the Himba tribe in Namibia  11 green squares with one blue. The study found they couldn't pick out which was different from the others, but the same tribe has many words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they  picked it out immediately (second top left) 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them.

What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene.

The 51-year-old\u2019s Mitsubishi L200 Animal ploughed through undergrowth before hitting a tree \u2013 leaving Mrs Walters, 48, with serious injuries. She was flown to hospital by helicopter but died two days after the crash in March last year. Walters, who was also badly hurt in the incident, was charged with his wife\u2019s murder two months later \u2013 ten days after her funeral. The prosecution is claiming that conflict over sex was a main reason the couple\u2019s marriage had fallen apart. Charles Miskin, prosecuting, said earlier in the trial: \u2018One of the principal issues was sex. He seemed to want it all the time and she couldn\u2019t cope with his demands.\u2019 But giving evidence yesterday, Walters described his love life with Tracy as \u2018very fulfilling\u2019, adding: \u2018It was very exciting and adventurous. She taught me things I never knew. It was very refreshing and usually initiated by Tracy rather than myself.\u2019 Walters went on to say that when they had sex it tended to be \u2018long, dramatic and adventurous\u2019 but lacked the \u2018intimacy\u2019 he craved. He added: \u2018What I needed was intimacy. What I needed was more than the touching. I wanted to fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms.\u2019 Quizzed over texts Tracy had sent to friends complaining that Walters had made her feel like \u2018a sex object\u2019, Walters agreed with the defence counsel that \u2018his sex drive was higher than Tracy\u2019s\u2019. And he admitted that as their relationship had worn on their sex life had waned. The jury also heard that the couple had a \u2018troubled\u2019 relationship, with Mrs Walters telling relatives and police that her husband had been abusive to her. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider,\u00a0was flown to hospital following the collision in Markfield, Leicester, but died two days later from her injuries . She made an application under \u2018Clare\u2019s Law\u2019 to discover if he had a violent past. The pair, who had both been married once before, had grown-up children from their previous relationships. They started dating in 2011, and got married a year later in Cyprus. Mr Miskin told the court that the abuse started almost straight away, with Mrs Walters showing relatives bruises she claimed her husband had inflicted. Mrs Walters also texted a relative of one of her sons just an hour before the crash to say: \u2018I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don\u2019t want to wind him up.\u2019 The couple were returning to their home in Swindon when Walters suddenly swerved his car off the carriageway and into a tree. The prosecution claim that Mrs Walters \u2018couldn\u2019t cope with her husband\u2019s demands\u2019 in bed, and that Walters purposely crashed to show his wife \u2018who was in charge\u2019. But Walters is claiming that at the time of the crash he had been taking antidepressants which sometimes made him drowsy. He told the court that he could recall two times when he had fallen asleep at the wheel, the last of which was on a motorway in 2002. He said he had also had three fainting episodes in the two years prior to the crash. Walters denies murder. The trial continues. The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash .

Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' and ruin a dieter's good intentions. The new research, done on fish and mice, could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume. The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. On the left, images of normal hypothalamus POMC cells from a developing mouse. On the right: when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted, the cells no longer make it . The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese \u2013 as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex \u2013 and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'", "label": 0.7083333333333334, "predicted": 0.5371392965316772}, "36": {"text": "Carl Frampton has branded Eddie Hearn's \u00a31.5million offer to fight Scott Quigg as little more than a 'publicity stunt'.

A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.", "label": 0.0625, "predicted": 0.5212167501449585}, "38": {"text": "(Billboard)The key to rock's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance. So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday night, there was as much recognition for rock's antecedents in soul and blues, speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that's beyond words. It's easy to talk of such spirit when Paul McCartney is there to honor Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono is on hand as well. Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, \"just sad John and George aren't here,\" referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison. Starr was certainly happy to be there \u2014 after a long wait, he's the final Beatle to be inducted as a solo act. \"I've finally been invited, and I love it,\" said the 74-year-old drummer. \"I got lucky, and it was actually in Cleveland,\" he said to enormous applause. Fifty-one years earlier, Starr had been in town to play the very same Hall; he admitted backstage that he didn't remember the cops stopping the show during \"All My Loving\" and making the Beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed. Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between. \"I'll remember this one,\" he promised. Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan. It was a night for the young to honor the old and perhaps prepare for a later visit. John Mayer hailed his longtime idol, the late Vaughan, in a heartfelt speech. John Legend came out to honor Bill Withers with a performance of \"Use Me\" backed by Stevie Wonder, who inducted Withers. The two then shared \"Lean on Me,\" until Legend went and pulled Withers to the front of the stage to join them. Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bill Withers, Seymour Stein hit Rock Hall's weekend festivities . The 76-year old soul legend hasn't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more. Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up. \"This has got to be the biggest AA meeting [in the] Western hemisphere,\" said Withers, alluding to an earlier moment in the show when Jimmie Vaughan confessed, \"I taught my brother guitar, and he taught me how to get sober.\" He called being inducted by Wonder, \"A lion holding the door for a kitty cat.\" The moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late Lou Reed by Patti Smith and Reed's widow, music artist Laurie Anderson, who shared the three rules for life that they came up with: \"One: don't be afraid of anyone; Two: get a really good b------t detector and learn how to use it; Three: be really, really tender.\" Smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions. She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up. She found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him. Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches. Cracked Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump: \"I feel like I'm in a line at the DMV.\" As one of the youngest acts, it's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening. Rock Hall induction ceremony: Lou Reed 'would be amused,' says sister . The other belonged to Tom Morello, Doyle Bramhall II and Zac Brown with harmonica player Jason Ricci performing \"Born in Chicago\" in tribute to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive. Miley Cyrus inducted Joan Jett in her own inimitable way, recalling a time she walked in on Jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength, wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker. Jett joined the Blackhearts and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as \"Bad Reputation,\" the Runaways' \"Cherry Bomb\" and \"Crimson and Clover,\" the Tommy James & the Shondelles cover that Jett took to No. 1. It was that kind of a night, and it closed with a rousing version of the Beatles' \"I Want to Be Your Man,\" where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did, including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between Gary Clark Jr., Morello, Zac Brown and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. \u00a92015 Billboard.

The 47-year-old, from Handsworth in Birmingham, has been given a community order, told to carry out unpaid work and fined \u00a3185 for harassing the victim. Linton's son started at Perry Beeches secondary school in September last year, the court heard. Helen Shipley, prosecuting, said that Linton approached head of year Mr O'Brien in October and expressed concern that she could not afford to send her son on a forthcoming residential trip. She was told that the school could come to an alternative arrangement, but failed to attend a scheduled meeting and then abused Mr O'Brien over the phone. Miss Shipley said: 'Linton felt that the school, in particular Mr O'Brien, was unfairly targeting her son, who had been placed in detention over having a mobile phone in class.' In another incident, Linton was shouting and acting aggressively outside the school entrance, and was told to leave the premises. School officials then sent the angry mother a letter telling her she was banned, and could only communicate with the school via the assistant headteacher or in her son's pass book. In January, she wrote a message in the book referring to the phone row she had with Mr O'Brien and abusing him for being gay.

Lucy, who, according to Heat magazine, is tipped to be making an appearance in the E4 show in the next few weeks, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL recently caught up with  the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns  Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Lucy models cut-out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar . Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren\u2019t terrible but they also weren\u2019t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it  hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout  incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have. I also want to increase my strength.' So how can we emulate her taut stomach? Ashton said: 'Lucy has a great flat tummy but isn\u2019t looking for washboard abs. In our sessions, we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist. 'We then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked. On top of this, we add rotational movements such as seated twists. This ensures Lucy has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts.' He added: 'Lucy also ensures her diet is clean, luckily there wasn\u2019t much we needed to change but its true what they say, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen.' Ashton and Lucy's typical workout  will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes. Lucy showed off her style credentials at the F&F AW15 show in London last week . Lucy has also been following a healthy diet, which she posts on her Instagram page, to complement her fitness regime. As her trainer says,\u00a0abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen . The duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press-ups. 'Every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury-free and we often throw in HIIT (high intensity interval training) finishers to add in a cardio element,' he said. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there'. He added: 'Everyone trains for different reasons. There are strong people, there are skinny people, but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies. Having people like Lucy show young females that you can enjoy life, eat well, train and reap the rewards is great.'

A pilot has commited suicide by  intentionally crashing his plane into a field in Northern California the day after pleading not guilty to domestic violence charges, authorities said Tuesday . Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, had been accused of physically assaulting his then-partner in February, and appeared Shasta County Superior Court in Redding on Friday. Before the crash on Saturday, Stickler had sent text messages to friends and family indicating he was distraught and planned to kill himself. He had been charged with  felony count of making criminal threats and a misdemeanor battery charge, Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. The charges stemmed from an argument in February in Redding, California, that escalated and became physical, Bridgett said. The alleged victim was living with Stickler at the time and reported an attack in their home. According to the police report, she claimed Stickler had gotten violent and then left their home, and that her cellphone had been destroyed in the process. She declined medical attention. Stickler killed himself by crashing into a pasture in in Millville, California, about 20miles from Redding, on Saturday morning, Shasta County Sheriff's Deputy Dustin Reynolds said. Sheriff's officials responded to a report of an explosion around 8:30am and found a small debris field at the site where the single-engine Cessna crashed. There was no indication Stickler had wanted to hurt anyone else, Reynolds added. A former boss has spoken of his shock at hearing of Stickler's death and the domestic violence charges.

'I'm absolutely shocked. There was nothing like that whatsoever in his behavior. 'The young man was very professional with what he did here. We were really happy with him.' Lamberton also said that Stickler had left the company in order for his girlfriend could pursue an opportunity elsewhere, and that he had offered to provide the 34-year-old with a reference.

Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage\u00a0of stroke patients\u00a0who are affected\u00a0by facial\u00a0weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around \u00a33,000 privately.

Boy? Girl? Young? Old?\" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. \"We can get,\" he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this \"unofficial\" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to \"foster\" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his \"madam\" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as \"sister.\" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to \"foster\" the children. He told me, \"Sister, Jesus will reward me,\" so the \"fostering\" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would \"live in my heart.\" If I could also then find it \"in my heart\" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be \"God's work.\" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate \"donation\" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.", "label": 0.05000000074505806, "predicted": 0.3597014546394348}, "48": {"text": "Facebook has come under fire after removing a video that shows Aboriginal women in a traditional ceremony because they were topless.

I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.", "label": 0.4642857263485591, "predicted": 0.3241502344608307}, "51": {"text": "Ben Grower (above), a Labour councillor, refused to deal with a constituent because they supported Ukip, it has been claimed .

Tsunami debris: A chunk of a fiberglass boat 25-30' long has been spotted floating off the Oregon shore . Rescued: These live yellowtail jack fish, native to Japan, were found inside the floating debris and are now being housed in the Oregon Coast Aquarium . The several live yellowtail jack fish found on board will be delivered to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean when the tsunami struck four years ago. About 70 per cent of it sank, leaving about 1.5 million tons floating with scientists saying they expect more debris to hit Alaska and the West Coast of North America for years to come. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. In 2013, a floating island of debris the size of Texas crossed the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas. The Oregan authorities plan to tow the boat segment to the Port of Newport for temporary storage. 'The debris appears to be half to two-thirds of a larger vessel, possibly damaged and set adrift during the earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan in 2011,' said\u00a0Chris Havel of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.

It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes. Having already irked certain Reds fans for refusing to dedicate his immediate future to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team after being offered the improved contract offer, he could again cut an unpopular figure for putting his health at risk during the Merseysiders\u2019 run in to fight for a top four place in the Premier League.

At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. Scroll down for video . Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorists, according to an Iraqi source . However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian. Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren\u2019t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. News of the attack follows contradictory accounts of al-Baghdadi being killed in air strikes in November and December . Another, an Iraqi expert on Isis used by the government in Baghdad in an advisory capacity, revealed that he had in fact been wounded. He said: \u2018Yes, he was wounded in al-Baaj near the village of Umm al-Rous on 18 March with a group that was with him.\u2019 This area is known to be largely lawless and a hotbed of jihadi activity, with very little Coalition air presence. Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies for defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that it\u2019s entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit, but warned that it might not have a long-term impact on the group if he didn't survive. He said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard these stories before. It's possible, as they would be going after him and they would be trying to drone him, but it\u2019s right to be suspicious. 'If he was killed it would have a big effect on the group as a lot of the group is wrapped up in his identity. The whole of Islamic State is built on success and if the leader is bumped off it\u2019s harder to say you\u2019re winning. \u2018But it\u2019s quite a resilient group. They would do a PR piece on it and say he\u2019s gone to a better place \u2013 but coherence often comes from leadership. \u2018However, it would not mean the end of the group by any stretch.\u2019 Last year there were two reports that Baghdadi had been wounded, but they turned out to be inaccurate. He escaped death in December when US jets attacked a two-car convoy on the outskirts of Mosul. His close aide Auf Abdul Rahman al-Efery was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one of the cars. Baghdadi was believed to be in the second car, which was not hit. Figures from February showed allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, had killed more than 6,000 fighters since September. The figure included more than half of the militants on the IS ruling council. Among the dead jihadists was also Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi\u2019s number two and the most senior IS militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on the 18-man leadership council forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists became increasingly small. Baghdadi, 43, was the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq before founding the Islamic State in Iraq in 2010, while he was declared head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2013.

The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost \u00a335,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children. When they sprung a small leak in part of the roof, they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about \u00a33,000. But after removing all the tiles, he then told them that the roof structure was unsound so he wouldn't be able to re-tile. He suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion. The couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a \u00a37,000 deposit for the work. Gaby said: 'The first builder appeared to be trustyworthy and was very professional, very likable. 'We didn't have time to check out the sub contractor he recommended as we were without a roof which we needed to be fixed.' A back view of the property shows how the garden was left looking like a rubbish tip while the house had no roof. The family had to live in one room for six months as they couldn't afford the repairs . So far the couple had paid the first builder \u00a310,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it. After the sub contractor began to work on their home, the first builder then disappeared. Phillip said: 'We heard from sub contractor that the builder's uncle was sick in Ireland so he was going there - we never hard from him again.' Meanwhile, the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for \u00a37,000 for materials and labour. But as the sub contractor got to work, the couple became suspicious about his competency. Gaby said: 'He was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for. 'That's when we realised he was trying to take us for a ride like the first guy.' Phillip added: 'When we told him it wasn't acceptable, he walked off the job. We were left with a roof no longer salvageable.' Shocking: The collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble . Daylight: With the tiles gone, the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements . The couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to Trading Standards. They have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as \u00a317,000 out of pocket. 'We have lost the home we have been building over the last few years, our whole house has been destroyed, it's been a living nightmare. We wish they have never knocked on our door,' Gabby wept. 'I just want it fixed. I still can't believe someone would leave me my husband and our two children in so much danger. They didn't need to leave us in such an unsafe way.'

Biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself. They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip. This image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides (coloured green and brown) interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes. The image on the right shows how the would looks on the surface at this stage in the healing process . The researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds that could speed up this process. Dr Mikhail Eltsov, one of the scientists behind the study at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, said: 'When we look at it from a distance, it appears as if skin cells simply fuse to each other, but if we zoom in, it becomes clear that membranes, molecular machines, and other cellular components are involved. 'Our electron microscope allows us to distinguish the molecular components in the cell that act like small machines to fuse the skin. 'In order to visualize this orchestra of healing, a very high-resolution picture of the process is needed. 'For this purpose we have recorded an enormous amount of data that surpasses all previous studies of this kind.' Dr Eltsov and his colleagues used cells from fruit fly embryos to study the healing processes that take place in skin. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Cell Biology, found that the skin cells on either side of the wound begin by 'sniffing' each other out to find their opposing partners. They then develop adhesive like structure made of microscopic tubes, called microtubules, that pulls them closer together. These attachments work a like velcro and pulls the skin cells towards the opening. Once the cells meet, they use these microtubules as a scaffolding to interlock together like a zip. Professor Achilleas Frangakis, a microscopy expert at Goethe University Frankfurt who led the study, said: 'What was also amazing was the tremendous plasticity of the membranes in this process which managed to close the skin opening in a very short space of time. 'When five to ten cells have found their respective neighbors, the skin already appears normal.' Skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living. Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers. They believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves, which cost the US alone more than $25 billion (\u00a317 billion) a year. The scientists stripped out the skin\u2019s inner layer \u2013 the dermis \u2013 which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its matrix of proteins. The team discovered that \u2018decellulised\u2019 skin provides a scaffold that the recipients own cells can populate and can effectively treat acute wounds, such as burns.

Less than two weeks after the incident, Langley walked back her previous statements in interviews with reporters, and on Tuesday afternoon she held a press conference that she claims set the record straight. Standing on ASU's campus alongside civil rights leader Reverend Jarret Maupin, the 19-year-old Ms Langley said her earlier assault story was \u2019completely made up' and Durant was innocent. \u2018I was angry.

The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002. According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins.

CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning . They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy!

Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, has embarrassed husband and wife team Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook over their spelling, punctuation and grammar. In one section Mr Tanswell and Ms Snook promise that Ukip will 'take back control of our boarders' - so the teacher wrote in red: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house'. Scroll down for video . Back to school: A teacher has taken her red pen to an error-strewn Ukip leaflet that landed on her doormat . Back to basics: The teacher picked up on the use of boarders and wrote: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house' In their leaflet the councillors  also tell prospective voters: 'If you vote Ukip your get Ukip' - so the marker wrote: 'You'll?'. One handwritten note about the leaflet's opening paragraph says: 'This 'sentence' is long and obscure. It needs some punctuation if it is to make sense'. The Ukip candidates, from Frome, Somerset, defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May, having left the Lib Dems to improve their chances. Expert: Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children . Mr Tanswell today said his former party have 'hacked' his emails for information to create a slapdash  leaflet to scupper their election hopes, and has called in police. However,  a party source has suggested the leaflet is genuine. He said: 'They had to rewrite everything and it looks like they didn't have time to spell check it.' Mrs Howlett, a specialist teacher with 32 years' experience, told MailOnline she enjoyed a 'happy two minutes' correcting their work. Using a red pen she highlighted the incorrect use of words, lack of apostrophes, flabby language, poor spellings and use of Americanisms. Their error-strewn Ukip leaflet has been shared thousands of times online. Mrs Howlett said: 'I marked it during a happy two minutes last night. I had heard about the leaflet from friends and my husband brought home a copy and straight away I told him I was eager to take a red pen to it. 'The part about borders - or boarders - \u00a0really made me laugh. I took a picture of my work and my children, Lucy and George, were very amused by it. They posted it to their friends, and it took off. 'I teach children who speak English as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them. There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar. Some of my nearest and dearest have a few issues at times, and I am certainly not poking fun at dyslexia. 'But what I am saying is that there is a problem when people don't recognise their own shortcomings. 'I have not met the candidates, but the leaflet suggests that if you can't check something like this properly, how can you run something properly if you were to be elected. 'I am most certainly not going to vote Ukip, absolutely not, but I will not say who I will be voting for. 'I won't discuss (Ukip) policies, I will just say that the children I work with are a delight, and some of them could teach Mr Tanswell a thing or two about apostrophes'.

Changes: Mrs Hewlett suggested in her red notes 'try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals' A picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on Reddit by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat. The leaflet also boasted about Snook and Tanswell's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local Cattle Market car park. Mr. Tanswell says the Liberal Democrats have put out the leaflet to 'stitch him up'. He said 'They have been hacking into my emails, the Liberal Democrats. They've hacked it all and I have the police looking at it now. 'It's the Liberal Democrats who are doing it all. They've hacked into my emails, they've basically got hold my stuff, they are producing it, they are sending it out, they are doing everything they can. 'I'm receiving about 20, 30 phone calls before 12 o'clock today threatening to kill me. The police are on to all of that'. Mr. Tanswell, 48, who runs a plumbing and heating company, added: 'I used to be a Liberal Democrat councillor. 'About a month ago, I left the Liberal Democrats to go UKIP and obviously a lot of them don't like it, so they are producing stuff like [the flyer] and putting it out and putting my name to it. 'I spoke to the police this morning. They are worried about it because people are making threats to kill me and stuff.

Bayern, chasing a treble of domestic and European titles, travelled with only 15 outfield players to Portugal for their quarter-final first leg leaving injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba, among others, behind. 'I am not prepared to criticise the team,' Rummenigge said in post-midnight banquet. 'There are 13 or 14 players who are at the moment healthy and have been playing three times a week.'

Neuer looks exasperated as the German champions concede their second goal of the game after 10 minutes . 'But there comes a day when you are a little bit tired, when your legs feel heavy and when you lack some of your concentration,' Rummenigge said. A lack of concentration certainly contributed to the three goals they conceded, each coming from an individual defensive mistake. What had been for much of the season their strongest asset - Bayern conceded just four goals in their first 17 Bundesliga games - was on Wednesday their Achilles heel. Jerome Boateng, Xabi Alonso and Dante, all lost possession or control near the box, allowing the Portuguese to score.

'We plan to re-open soon we just don't know when,' Crystal said. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'.

A new Indiana law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The news comes a little after a week  Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.\u2019 According to TMZ, O'Connor tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. The pizza joint has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes.

When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O\u2019Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from \u2018substantially burdening\u2019 the ability of people \u2014 including businesses \u2014 to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures \u2018religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.\u2019 Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down . Crystal O\u2019Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage \u2013 a conviction shared by her father. He said: \u2018That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?\u2019 The Facebook and Yelp pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family's controversial statements.

User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O\u2019Connor\u2019s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. \u2018I\u2019m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough!

Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. \"We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere,\" he recalls. \"We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof.  I grabbed my children and ran.\" His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. \"They took our homes and kicked us out,\" she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city.  ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory.  The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. \"We had been warning we could see their movements,\" he tells us. \"But we just didn't have the force to hold them off.  We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up.\" But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. \"Security is collapsing in the city,\" he screams. \"This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? \"Just God knows if we will survive this,\" he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's fa\u00e7ade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. \"A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded,\" he explains. \"We went out to help him and the second one fell on us.\" His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. \"I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open,\" she says, as tears roll down her face. \"Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down.\" She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003.  Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. \"When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse.\" A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. \"Anyone want tea?\" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours.  \"This happens all the time, we're used to it.\" The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond.  Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad.  Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions.  He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds.  The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. \"Ramadi is under siege from all sides,\" he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. \"I consider the city to have fallen.\" He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi.

Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have since reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier. Both women died in 'freak accidents' to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140 ft to her death shortly before their 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. First wife, Lynn Rishell, was crushed to death under Henthorn's jeep when, according to Henthorn, the jack gave way as she reached beneath the vehicle for a lug nut while changing a flat tire at night on an isolated highway near the couple's Colorado home. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Henthorn was charged with the murder of Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier . Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark . In both cases Henthorn was the sole beneficiary of the women's substantial life insurance policies totalling $500,000 in the case of his first wife and $4.5million in the case of his second. Now, newly filed documents have revealed that he is fighting for a $1.5million pay out from the policy taken out in July 2001 on the grounds that he needs the money to pay for his attorney for the forthcoming murder trial scheduled to begin next month. The documents, filed yesterday and seen by Daily Mail Online, are part of a bitter civil case being fought in Douglas County .They note that, just weeks before he is due to stand trial, Henthorn is 'focused solely on his own desire to have the insurance proceeds disbursed to himself without any meaningful process.' They go onto state: 'Should Henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter, those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this District.' They point out: 'The Colorado Supreme Court has said: \"Killers cannot receive life insurance proceeds from their victims\" and insurers cannot disburse proceeds \"prematurely\", \u2026.when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending.' The next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with Dr Bertolet, Hayley. Dr Bertolet died on 29 September, 2012. The autopsy report, dated 18 December 2012, stated that she 'died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking.' It concluded, 'homicide cannot be excluded.' But when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later, on September 27, 2013 he gave her cause of death as 'Accidental Fall.' At the time Henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an FBI investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower's life, culminating in his arrest last November. But despite facing murder charges Henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife's death. Shockingly, not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense, documents filed in a separate motion in March show that he fought his late wife's family to have funds from Dr Bertolet's estate released into his possession. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in Dr Bertolet's family's favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an 'imminent risk of substantial harm..to [its] financial interests.' Both \u2018freak accidents\u2019 occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell,\u00a0was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . Henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as December and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife's estate. In March Daily Mail Online revealed that, in 2009 Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law, Grace Rishell. Grace was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet's murder case, 'the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' But she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Yet unbeknownst to her, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,' with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in RIshell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was denied bail by US District Attorney Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a 'danger' and said, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second.' She pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Henthorn's trial is scheduled to begin in September.

In May 2014, Benito Gonzalez Jr.,46, was suspended from duty after being arrested for allegedly exposing his genitals and touching himself inappropriately while seated at a table in a Cherry Hill Starbucks, police say. A surveillance photo posted to the Cherry Hill police Facebook page led to the 17-year Camden police veteran's arrest -- the photo has since been deleted and is now being used as evidence, the\u00a0Courier-Post\u00a0reports. Blame: Benito Gonzalez, 46 (photographed),\u00a0who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame . The father-of-three was found guilty of the offense last month and is currently suspended without pay, the Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0reports . While county officials are working to fire the lieutenant's, the Post reports, Gonzalez claims the incident -- which he says he does not remember -- is the culmination of a three-year downward spiral following a traumatic experience more than three years ago, the  Inquirer\u00a0\u00a0reports. It all began in June 2011 when Gonzalez, who ran the department's narcotics unit, had an encounter with a drug dealer, 32-year-old Adam Reed. In the altercation, Gonzalez dived to the ground, injuring his hamstrings, as Reed fired shots at him from a handgun. Reed then pointed the gun at Gonzalez's head and pulled the trigger. But the weapon malfunctioned, saving Gonzalez's life, and Reed was later sentenced to 66 years in prison, the Inquirer reports. 'I just saw my life completely over,' Gonzalez told the Inquirer, 'I thought I was dead.' Gonzalez's career seemed to flourish and the 46-year-old was even promoted to lieutenant in 2013. But Gonzalez said he used his job as a way to escape his crumbling mental health. Starbucks: Police Say Gonzalez walked into this Starbucks in Cherry Hill, while off-duty, pulled down his pants and masturbated at one of the coffee-shops tables . In evaluations after the incident, psychologists recognized that Gonzalez had issues linked to the trauma and reportedly gave him the task of deciding whether to stay with the department. He chose to stay and tried hiding his problems from his co-workers telling the Inquirer that he didn't want to seem 'weak' or incapable of dong his job. In the years following the incident, Gonzalez would be diagnosed with PTSD, suffer panic attacks, experience flashbacks of the traumatic incident, and even contemplate suicide. It was not long after considering suicide that Gonzalez, while off-duty, walked into the Starbucks on Route 70 and committed the lewd act. Gonzales claims he was intoxicated and in a blackout state as a result of the trauma and only remembers drinking before going to the Starbucks and returning home that night, the Inquirer reports. He said he did not know he had been at the Starbucks until police contacted him and told him he was being charged. Gonzalez is set to appear at an administrative hearing Wednesday where his attorney will ask the department to briefly reinstate the lieutenant so he could apply for his more than $60,000 accidental-disability pension -- which law enforcement officials can receive after suffering disabilities from an incident, the Inquirer reports. The pension represents a majority of Gonzalez's income, needed to provide for his wife and three children, aged 16, 15, and 8. His wife says she fears the family will have to move from its home due to the financial strain. While the fate of Gonzalez's pension is unknown, the Post reports that a judge last month approved Gonzalez's participation in a conditional dismissal program. The program would require Gonzalez to undergo a one-year probationary period where he would be monitored. If he does not violate the probation, the lewdness charge could be dismissed, and he could have the charge expunged from his records six months later.", "label": 0.4264706000685692, "predicted": 0.6555573344230652}, "81": {"text": "The time of their lives has turned into the holiday from hell for up to 2500 passengers stranded on a cruise ship, the Carnival Spirit, outside Sydney Harbour and riding a constant flow of smashing waves of more than nine metres.

The events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken. It was Good Friday, April 4 1915 and Britain was at war. As the two sides met, Manchester United were struggling to avoid relegation, while Liverpool were in mid-table. In an oddly tame affair, George Anderson put United 1-0 up before Liverpool defender Bob Pursell conceded a penalty yet United's Patrick O'Connell missed by some distance. Anderson added a second before Liverpool forward Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar and was seemingly chastised by teammates for trying to score.

United manager John Robson is alleged to have left the stadium in disgust. 'The second half was crammed with lifeless football,' reported The Manchester Daily Dispatch. 'United were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it. Liverpool scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score.' A fortnight later, handbills were circulated alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2\u20130 win to United. A suspiciously large number of bets had been made on that very scoreline causing odds to shorten to 4/1. The two points United won from the game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety. United with the three trophies they won in 1909. Turnbull is seated front right . The Sporting Chronicle published a notice from a bookmaker called 'Football King' who promised a substantial reward for information that would lead to punishment of the 'instigators of this reprehensible conspiracy'. It stated: 'We have solid grounds for believing that a certain First League match played in Manchester during Easter weekend was 'squared,' the home club being permitted to win by a certain score.' Mark Wylie, curator of the Manchester United museum, has been reflecting on the scandal this week as the 100th anniversary approaches with many questions still unanswered. 'Football was under intense scrutiny anyway, with it being wartime,' he said.' There had been so many complaints in the newspapers, in parliament, from the military, that professional football was being played while British soldiers, sailors and airmen were being killed, so the powers-that-be were anxious to see that football wasn't tarnished any further and they launched an investigation.' The Football League's lengthy delving found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West of United, and Jackie Sheldon, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Thomas Fairfoul of Liverpool. United captain Charlie Roberts holding the FA Cup on the steps of Manchester Town Hall . They were accused of plotting the events during clandestine meetings at the Dog and Partridge pub in Stretford. Sheldon, a former United player, was found to be the plot's ringleader. Liverpool's Fred Pagnam and United's George Anderson had refused to take part; Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his teammates remonstrating with him when he hit the crossbar. He later testified against them and claimed Sheldon had offered him \u00a33 in a taxi en route to the game. At the same hearing, United legend Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but said that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him.

On December 23, 1915, the seven were banned from playing for life. Stockport County's Lawrence Cook, a first class Lancashire cricketer, and Manchester City's Fred Howard were also suspended for their part in placing bets. A distraught West, the only United player to have appeared in the game, protested his innocence and sued the FA for libel. 'It wasn't a glorious episode,' says Wylie. 'Players could see that football was changing. With the sport under such scrutiny amid wartime, it was pretty obvious that football in 1915/16 would be very different, if it happened at all. Summer wages were being abolished, so once you got to the end of April there would be no wages until the end of August, and it was still unclear what would happen the following season. They could see their livelihood going. That was supposed to be encouragement for players to do things for the war effort.' By the time their bans were handed down, the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the First World War. It was suggested that if the men joined the armed forces their punishment would be rescinded. All except West, signed up. For Turnbull it was to have tragic consequences. The death certificate of Sandy Turnbull (right), featuring the memorial at Arras in France . A forward of great repute, Turnbull was a Boys' Own character who had joined United from Manchester City with Meredith. The fiesty Scot, pioneered the first footballers union and his 1909 FA Cup final winning goal prompted United's owners to build Old Trafford to herald a new dawn. Fittingly, Turnbull, who lived in Maine Road, scored United's first goal at the Theatre of Dreams. Yet following the betting scandal and facing a life without football, Turnbull went to war. Sadly, on May 3 1917, at the age of 33, Lance Sergeant Sandy Turnbull was killed during a muddled, unsuccessful night attack on German lines just east of Arras, France. His body was never found. He left a widow, Florence, and four young children. The FA gave him a posthumous reinstatement. All the other players, except West, had their bans lifted by the FA in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country. West, who had been good friends with Turnbull, had continued to fight a different battle, one to clear his name. In February 1916, when United and Liverpool played in a regional match, he took to standing outside Old Trafford handing out handbills: '\u00a350 reward. To all whom it may concern: I, Enoch James West (late Manchester United), offer the above sum to be given to any Red Cross Fund if any person or persons can prove that I bet or won any money in any way over the match at Old Trafford, Manchester United v. Liverpool, on Good Friday, 1915, the said match over which I got suspended. (Signed) Enoch James West, 68 Railway Road, Old Trafford. West twice unsuccessfully attempted to sue the FA for libel and in 1918 was caught and banned again for playing under an assumed name for a club in Ireland. He was eventually pardoned under a general amnesty in 1945, by which time he was aged 59. He had served the longest ban in football and maintained his innocence until his death in 1965. His family carried on his fight. A book entitled 'Free the Manchester United One' by Graham Sharpe pleaded Enoch's case. On publishing, Sharpe said: 'I am confident that at the very least, I have established that there is little or no genuine evidence which can be interpreted as conclusive proof of the guilt of Enoch West as he was charged.' West's great grandson, Graham West, said: 'I would just like to set the record straight, Enoch 'Knocker' West was wrongly accused of match fixing and he protested his innocence till his death bed. Having been accused of this, it broke his heart, all he lived for was football. He died a broken man thanks to these accusations that were never proved.' Sadly, the full truth may now never be known.

Lord Coe is challenging Ukraine's pole vault icon Sergey Bubka for the presidency of world athletics governing body the IAAF, to replace Lamine Diack, who steps down in August. Coe, the former chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG), believes sporting boycotts only 'damage competitors and athletes'. Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko told German newspaper Bild the country's allies should consider boycotting the 2018 FIFA tournament in Russia if Moscow does not pull all of its troops out of his territory. Lord Sebastian Coe believes that boycotts only serve to 'damage competitors and athletes' 'I will always oppose boycotts of sport, because I don't think they actually achieve what they set out to do,' said Coe. 'The only people they really damage are competitors and athletes.' Poroshenko told Bild he will push Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel towards tougher sanctions against Russia, citing the fact Shakhtar Donetsk are forced to host matches 1,200km away in Lviv because their home city is occupied by pro-Russia separatists. 'I think there has to be discussion of a boycott of this World Cup. As long as there are Russian troops in Ukraine I think a World Cup in that country is unthinkable,' Poroshenko told Bild. Coe, however, believes politicians should use sport as a 'soft power' to try to bring about change through inclusion rather than exile or boycott. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko wants Russia to withdraw all troops from his territory . Conflicts have been ongoing between Ukraine and Russia, leading to a call for a 2018 World Cup boycott . 'I think it is far better to have sport as a soft power, helping change all sorts of things, and we can't pick, we can't a la carte menu sport,' said Coe. 'You either believe in its power to change and to be a catalyst for social and political change or you don't. 'I happen to believe that sport has done far more to bring communities together than to isolate and separate them.' Coe was back at the centre of the triumphant 2012 Olympic Games on Monday, the Olympic Park, to launch the 2015 Morrisons Great Newham London Run. The 10k run will be held on Sunday, July 19, and will be the first event staged in the former Olympic Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Coe rates coaxing more young people into athletics as the greatest challenge facing the sport, and his ideas to boost participation form the crux of his manifesto for the IAAF presidency. The double Olympic gold medal winner said it was important he took time out of his hectic campaign schedule to continue the legacy work from London 2012. 'I will support anything, particularly running, but anything that adds to the lustre and legacy of this extraordinary park,' said Coe.

Through finding a preschool class photograph, the couple realized they had actually met 16 years previously, when they were three years old. While at his girlfriend's house, believed to be in the U.S., Reddit user Evanaka1234 came across an old school photo of her and recognized her immediately, claiming that she looked like an 'imp'. Reddit user Evanaka found this preschool class photo in his girlfriend's house while trying to find a rice cooker . He recognized his girlfriend immediately, but then realized the boy next to her looked familiar as well. He then discovered that the boy next to his girlfriend was him and that the couple had unknowingly gone to preschool together . But as he stared at the photo he realized the blond boy next to his girlfriend, who has not been named, looked familiar. Then it hit him: The little boy next to his girlfriend was him. He couldn't believe it, so he called his mom, who confirmed the name of his preschool, which was in fact the school his girlfriend went to, even though neither of them remember it. Evanaka1234 posted the picture on Reddit, sharing his story with the world. Sixteen years later the couple are together again, except as a couple rather than classmates. It is unknown how long the couple has been dating. Daily Mail Online tried to reach out to Evanaka1234, but did not get a response.

The fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the Premier League season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular Championship campaign, which could mean an extended break for the likes of Reading pair Chris Gunter and Hal Robson-Kanu.

'There was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the Belgium game in June,' Williams said. 'When the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling.

The next five matches will have a big bearing on whether Van Gaal's maiden season at the club will be regarded as a success or failure. United are two points inside the top four with 10 matches to go and after Sunday's game against Tottenham, they face Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea. Louis van Gaal is targeting second place in the Barclays Premier League with a late push in the run-in . The Manchester United manager believes catching local rivals Manchester City is an achievable target . Despite a run of three defeats in 23 matches, some supporters have complained about a lack of tempo, flair and width from Van Gaal's side. But, crucially, the United boss thinks he still has the support of the Glazer family, who own the club, and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. 'I have faith that I can complete my three years,' the United manager said. 'I think they are pleased with my way of managing the club.' Van Gaal proudly recalled the long list of successes to support his point at a press conference on Friday. The Dutchman reminded those present that he had won silverware in his first season at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Ryan Giggs and Van Gaal haven't had the greatest season but are still well in with a chance of a top four spot . The 63-year-old also recalled the fact that he won the 2008-09 Eredivisie with AZ Alkmaar a year after finishing 11th. 'I said I will (leave) but the (AZ) players came to my house to ask me to stay, and the board also,' he said. 'Then we were the champion.' Van Gaal accepts it will be 'very difficult' to win a trophy in his maiden year in England. United are out of the FA Cup following their quarter-final defeat to Arsenal and they are 10 points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand. Van Gaal's sole task is bringing Champions League football back to Old Trafford. The Dutchman has not contemplated what failure would cost United. 'No. I don't think I am here to think about the financial consequences. That is Ed Woodward. I am here to manage the professional football department of Manchester United,' Van Gaal said. United are facing a difficult run following their FA Cup exit at the hands of Arsenal last Monday . Van Gaal has been criticised for his 'long ball' tactics but insists the club support his philosophy . 'I am here because of my qualities and my philosophy. That we have spoken about in our first sessions with each other, Ed Woodward and myself. After that I have spoken with the Glazers. Because of those discussions I am here now. 'I am not thinking of the consequences if we are not in the first four. It is very bad for the club. But why do we have to speak about things that are not happening yet? 'We are longer in the top four than Arsenal.' Van Gaal is likely to receive significant backing in the transfer market regardless of where United finish. Most of last year's signings continue to struggle. Angel di Maria cost \u00a359.7million but his star has faded fast after an encouraging start. British football's record signing is suspended for Sunday's match against Spurs after being sent off for tugging referee Michael Oliver's shirt in the defeat to Arsenal. The Argentinian has also had to deal with off-the-pitch problems, most notably a house move after his Cheshire mansion was targeted by burglars in February. Van Gaal insists Di Maria is happy at United and believes he will be at the club next season despite rumours of interest from abroad. Angel di Maria pleads his innocence after being booked by referee Michael Oliver in the defeat to Arsenal . Oliver shows the red card to Di Maria  after he tugged at the referees shirt following a yellow card . 'As a manager you can never say no or yes because, in the end, the player shall always decide. But I don't think he shall move,' Van Gaal said. 'Nevertheless, his incident with his wife at home, he is very pleased to be here at Manchester United. 'I think that he shall stay because his reaction after the defeat and the red card is very good. I like his attitude.' Van Gaal says his door is always open if Di Maria or any other player becomes unhappy. Van Gaal insists Di Maria will stay at Old Trafford, despite his unrest both on and off the field . 'I am always like that,' he said. 'That is part of my philosophy. A football player is not only a man who kicks the ball. Also, his environment is influencing him. I shall always be open for (that). 'I know also the commercial interests of the club and we have to respect that also because you cannot give a lot of money for the player and the next season you put him out of your selection,' Van Gaal added. 'It is also the quality of the player.

The BBC documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in New Delhi that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by Mukesh Singh, the interviewed convict, were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary. The government has also asked Google to remove excerpts of the film from video sharing site YouTube. A Google India spokeswoman, Paroma Roy Chowdhury, said it would comply on the Indian YouTube site, \"as we are required to do so by the local law.\" A statement from the company read: \"While we believe that access to information is the foundation of a free society, and that services like YouTube help people express themselves and share different points of view, we continue to remove content that is illegal or violates our community guidelines, once notified.\" Udwin told CNN the restrictions appear to have been motivated by fear of \"public disorder.\" \"I presume they mean protests,\" she said. It was, in fact, the street protests, not the brutality of the crime, that first inspired Udwin to make the film. But Udwin, who spent 16 hours interviewing Singh in prison over the course of three days, said the experience was chilling. \"He told me everything that happened that night, he told me everything about his attitudes towards society, women, hanging, all sorts... He blamed her -- the society blames girls, the society itself,\" she said. \"Look here's the thing: All this hysteria... people must understand these men are products of a learned attitude. They are programmed, they are brainwashed. The society itself tells girls to stay indoors after dark.\" Udwin said she had done everything she could to elicit a human response from Singh. She even had a list of the girl's horrific rape-inflicted injuries, from which she died, read to him in Hindi while she recorded his face. \"There were a few twitches but there was no remorse, there was no emotion, I don't think he is capable of emotion,\" she said. Singh, who was driving the bus on which the girl was attacked while traveling home from the movies with a male friend, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. But all Singh says about how he, and the other men convicted over the rape, have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when \"everybody's doing it,\" Udwin said. At the heart of the matter, she said, is the issue of gender inequality. From birth, boys in India and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls, so it's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings. She compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women. The dead girl's father, who is also interviewed in the film, explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college, he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in India, Udwin said. \"When he did that, his whole family was in revolt,\" said Udwin. \"They said, 'Why are you selling it to educate a girl?' \"Now that is a comment that is in the documentary, uttered by the father. Why is nobody saying to me, 'How dare you put that comment in the documentary'?\" In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. But Udwin strongly rejected that claim. \"It would appear that the home minister has been utterly misinformed,\" she said. \"The permissions to interview this man were absolutely cast iron and all of the conditions imposed by them were obeyed by me and my team.\" Udwin also speaks out for the \"massive swaths of Indian people who are so forward looking, who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change. \"There are extraordinary women's groups who have been working for generations towards this change. Those protests were so admirable -- that's what took me out there.\" And she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to India. The film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries, she said, including the United States and United Kingdom. This means that \"no viewer is is left off the hook at the end of the film in terms of thinking, 'This is something that happens to people over there.' This happens to us, to every country,\" Udwin said.

Fred Craddock, the pulpit giant who was \"like no other preacher you have ever heard,\" has died, his church announced. Craddock, who redefined the art of preaching, died Friday in Blue Ridge, Georgia. The cause has not been disclosed. The 86-year-old had been in declining health due to Parkinson's disease in recent years, according to the United Methodist Reporter. \"Fred Craddock was a national treasure and a devoted servant of the church and Jesus Christ. His impact on preaching -- in terms both of scholarship and practice -- is incalculable,\" said the Rev. Thomas Long, a friend and a pastor at Emory University's Candler School of Theology. Craddock faces his toughest convert . Preachers studied classic Craddock sermons such as \"Have You Heard John Preach?\" and \"Grace and Disgrace,\" much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist John Coltrane and amateur boxers studied tapes of Sugar Ray Robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration. Craddock elevated preaching to an art. He was often called a preaching genius. Rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an intro, three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an \"inductive\" conversational style of preaching. His sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was foreshadowing, plot twists, dialogue; language of startling beauty and surprise endings. The way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said. He would abruptly stop, turn from the pulpit, and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence. People didn't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons. They were too busy absorbing what he had just said. The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor, an author and world-renowned preacher, once said of Craddock: \"He spoke of Kierkegaard as easily as he spoke of the Indianapolis 500. He quoted Kafka as helpfully as Corinthians... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth.\" Craddock, who taught preaching at  the Candler School of Theology until his retirement, was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the English-speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996. I had a chance to meet Craddock, as well as hear him. I spent several weeks with him in the autumn of 2011 to write a profile about his relationship with his father. He was just as impressive outside the pulpit. He would ease his rotund little body in a wooden chair and share touching stories about growing up poor in the small town of Humboldt, Tennessee, during the Depression with an alcoholic father. He'd talk about the infirmities of old age -- I remember saying with a chuckle that \"I should have something\" when referring to his bout with Parkinson's because he was getting old. He was funny, folksy, witty and his eyes danced with glee when he told a story. Sitting in Craddock's presence was like listening to a wise uncle or grandmother. He had courtly, Southern manners, and he gave the impression that he had all the time in the world for you. I never once heard him criticize anyone. It's not uncommon to meet great people who, to borrow a phrase that Craddock used, have \"domestic wreckage\" at home. But the Craddock family was among his biggest fans. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nettie, for more than 50 years, and they had two children, Laura and John. Laura named her son after her father. And John, who became a CEO instead of a pastor, said his father was the most remarkable man he knew. \"I don't care if it's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the United States, he makes you feel as if you're the most important person in the world when he's talking to you,\" said John Craddock. \"I won the lottery as far as great fathers go.\" Over the years, I kept in contact with him. I'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved Craddock Center, a non-profit ministry that served needy children in North Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. The center provides books, hot meals, storytelling and music. Perhaps Craddock saw something of himself in the kids he helped. One thing is certain: He wasn't content to preach compassion. He lived that message. Craddock's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. Monday at Cherry Log Christian Church in Blue Ridge, Georgia.

Well done, keepers of the one-true-way-to-talk-about-race! If we don't tamp down the backlash against Starbucks \"Race Together\" campaign, I fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years. Is that really what we want? Look, I get it. Asking baristas to hold conversations about race is a lot to demand of already hard-working employees. Not to mention, the topic should probably be called \"systematic racism,\" not just \"race.\" And there are legitimate questions about what Starbucks could realistically hope to accomplish, here. But for crying out loud! In the past 48 hours, racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing Starbucks for trying to fight racism than they have against other (actually racist) companies. The truth is that we cannot have it both ways. We cannot demand that companies address race, and then attack them when they try. Yes, it seems like harmless fun to pile on or retweet the snark. At some point, all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online. But the cost this time is that no corporation will want to do anything creative or constructive on racial subjects for a very long time. In fact, some activists are responding with such little sympathy, empathy and grace, that other corporations are like to run the other way. Again, is that what we want? Mellody Hobson, an African-American member of the Starbucks board and a personal friend, is a major supporter of this campaign. How will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion? Starbucks is trying to make a positive difference. If the company gets rewarded, others will follow. But nobody wants their brand to get beaten up. At some point in the future, activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior. But how seriously will anyone take us, when even the \"good guys\" end up getting kicked in the teeth and called racist -- for trying to OPPOSE bigotry? Modern science tells us that bias lives on, in even the most dedicated anti-racist. The only cure is talking about it. Our country needs more open discussion of race, not less. Companies who try to further that discussion should be rewarded, even if their initial attempts are imperfect. We can put forward suggestions and criticisms in a constructive manner: \"This is a great first step, Corporation! Here are five ways to improve the campaign -- and make it even better.\" I think any human anywhere would be open to hearing that kind of feedback. But nobody wants to be called an idiot, just for trying. Unfortunately, today's vicious backlash against Starbucks could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished. Ironically, after all this is over, Starbucks will still sell plenty of lattes.

A new study has found that female horses are more attracted stallions with deeper, lower pitched whinnies. The lower frequency 'voices' of stallions tended to be associated with larger males, who had a calmer temperament and their offspring tended to survive for longer. Scroll down for video . Stallions, like the wild mustang above,  use their deep voices to attract the opposite sex, according to research . The researchers say that mares seem to make their choices about unfamiliar males on their first meeting based on the depth of their voices. And just like humans putting on an album featuring Barry White's bass-baritone voice, the deeper whinnies from male horses also appear to get the mares more in the mood. The researchers say the findings could also be used to help horse breeders select the best stallions for mating in the future. The domestication of the horse some 5,500 years ago ultimately revolutionized human civilization and societies. Horses facilitated transportation as well as the circulation of ideas, languages and religions. Horses also revolutionized warfare with the advent of chariotry and mounted cavalry and beyond the battlefield horses greatly stimulated agriculture. However, the domestication of the horse and the subsequent encroachment of human civilization also resulted in the near extinction of wild horses. The only surviving wild horse population, the Przewalski's horses from Mongolia, descends from mere 13 individuals, preserved only through a massive conservation effort. As a consequence of this massive loss of genetic diversity, the effects of horse domestication through times have been difficult to unravel on a molecular level. Professor Alban Lemasson, a biologist at the University of Rennes in France, said: 'The lower pitched the stallion's voice, the slower its heart beat and the higher its reproductive success. 'Stallion acoustic signals may play a role in female attraction at the time of group formation, as well as a role in sexual stimulation or libido maintenance when a group is formed. 'This supports preliminary findings showing that females base their approach preference towards certain unfamiliar males on the amount of vocal signals uttered during their first encounter and some male vocal signals trigger mare behavioural preparation for mating, for example tail lifting and leg parting.' In the wild, horses tend to live in harems consisting of one to two male adults and two to three females who have established stable bonds. When female juveniles reach sexual maturity they leave their group and form their own harem with bachelor males or join an existing harem. This may explain why 'voice' has become such an important characteristic in horses as females will often choose which harem to join from a long way off. Sound is an effective way for males to convey information to prospective mates and may be a way of avoiding the often violent fights that wild male rivals can engage in to win a mate. In a study published in the journal Public Library of Science One, Professor Lemasson and his colleagues recorded the calls of 15 breeding stallions from stud farms around France. The singer Barry White was known as the Walrus of Love due to his deep voice and reputation for singing romantic songs, but it seems he may have been copying a style of seduction already employed by male horses . They took blood and sperm samples from each of the horses and measured their heart beat. The researchers then played the recordings to 40 adult mares aged between seven and 27 years old at the Haras National du Pin in France. The females were placed in a corridor with a speaker at either end, through which a pair of whinnies from different stallions were played. The researchers found that the females tended to move with preference towards the speak playing the deeper whinnie. They also found that the males with deeper whinnies tended to be larger - suggesting they were stronger and so better able to protect the harem. Male stallions will often show off in an attempt to win a mate but it seems their whinnie is also important . They also had slower heart beats, meaning they were calmer and fewer of their offspring tended to die before or shortly after birth. Professor Lemasson told Mail Online: 'Whinnies potentially convey a mix of information about the sexual and social qualities of a male. 'In the wild, mares stay all your long with stallions, so finding the best social partner - dominant, calm and fertile - may be important.' The preference among female horses for deep voices is not unique. Female humans have been found to find men with lower voices more attractive. Koalas, bison and giant pandas have also been found to be more attracted to males with deeper calls. Professor Lemasson added: 'Our data also confirm that not all male voices are equally attractive, opening new lines of bioacoustic research on mammal reproduction.'", "label": 0.47500000335276127, "predicted": 0.5181111097335815}, "110": {"text": "A 4,000-year-old Egyptian statue which was sold by a council for nearly \u00a316million to an overseas buyer has been banned from leaving Britain.

Above, the artifact picture in Christie's last year . But in July last year the council sold off the piece, which they have owned for more than 100 years, insisting it wasn\u2019t the centrepiece of their collection. The Egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to Egypt if Northampton did not want it, and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide. A Northampton council spokesman said the export ban had \u2018no impact\u2019 on the council\u2019s sale of the statue \u2013 and insisted it was a matter for the government and Arts Council England to resolve between them. Tomb model: The statue of Sekhemka, on display at Christie's, London, ahead of its sale last year . The statue of Sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near Cairo. The tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig, with his wife, son and offering-bearers. Sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the Old Kingdom sometime between 2,700BC and 2,2250BC - the period of Egyptian history when the pyramids of Giza were built. In a country that was mainly illiterate, his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices. At first, tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family. But as the economy improved, officials like Sekhemka who held high-ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb. They served two purposes: to act as a record of the way the person looked, and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue's hands - were made after his death. It is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at Northampton Museum, but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s. It has been on display at various Norhampton museums until two years ago. The statue, which stands just 30in high, has been praised as a work of 'outstanding aesthetic importance' by culture minister Ed Vaizey. He added it was 'the finest example of any kind in the world'.

The interview was brought up by Jeremy Paxman during Thursday's live TV debate with Mr Miliband and David Cameron. Mr Danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist Katie Hopkins on Twitter over race relations. Hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in Rochdale next to a Pakistani flag. She linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town, which led to jailing of a gang of Asian men for 77 years in 2012. But Mr Danczuk accused her of spreading 'vitriol' and of 'racist generalisation'. Mrs Dancuk, known as the Queen of the Selfies, is a former Rochdale councillor who announced she was stepping down earlier this year to pursue other career opportunities, including media work. She became known for posting a series of racy images of herself on Twitter and revealed in February she had been sexually abused as a child.", "label": 0.4250000100582838, "predicted": 0.5905603766441345}, "112": {"text": "A top-secret sporty new 200mph \u2018baby\u2019 Bentley fit for a 21st century James Bond broke cover tonight. The wraps came off Bentley\u2019s stunning new two-seater Aston Martin rival on the eve of the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland. The prototype coupe will be available for an estimated \u00a3130,000 price tag when it goes on sale within three years. Scroll down for video . Bentley 'baby': The EXP 10 Speed 6 is pictured today ahead of the 85th International Motor Show in Geneva . Unveiling: Bentley CEO Wolfgang Durheimer speaks next to the EXP 10 Speed 6 at the event in Switzerland . And Bentley bosses believe the two-seater GT grand tourer is just the job to tempt 007 to \u2018defect\u2019 from his big screen affair with Aston Martin stretching over five decades and go back to his first love from the original Ian Fleming books: a Bentley. Bond\u2019s relationship with Aston Martin dates back to the original DB5 in Goldfinger to the new DB10 in the forthcoming movie Spectre. Bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty \u2018baby\u2019 Bentley to take on Aston Martin, Ferrari and Maserati. It comes as Bentley also prepares to launch its first 4x4 sports utility vehicle called Bentayga. Leading motor magazine Autocar produced images of how the sleek new two-seater to be built at Crewe would look. But there was a chance tonight to see the real thing in the metal. The new car is likely to be powered initially by a specially-tweaked 500 brake-horse-power 4.0 litre twin-turbo engine introduced recently into other Bentley models. Through the smoke:The wraps came off Bentley\u2019s stunning new two-seater Aston Martin rival today . Favourite: James Bond\u2019s relationship with Aston Martin dates back to the original DB5 in Goldfinger to the new DB10 in the forthcoming movie Spectre. He is pictured last month with the DB10 during filming in Rome . But higher powered options are also likely to match the 200mph top speed of other cars in the Bentley range. And though already widely dubbed Bentley\u2019s new \u2018baby\u2019, bosses stressed that it will not be a noticeably small car, despite having fewer seats and just two doors. It is set to sit alongside the existing Bentley Continental GT rather than below it, say insiders. The British-based but German-owned luxury car firm is part of the giant Volkswagen Group and employs nearly 4,000 people at Crewe. The car was the star of the packed Volkswagen Group night in Geneva which attracted hundreds of journalists and executives. Bentley sales director Kevin Rose said: \u2018Emotionally for an Englishman it\u2019s fascinatingly attractive. And we\u2019ve got a very good Bond at the moment in Daniel Craig. Interior:\u00a0Bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty \u2018baby\u2019 Bentley to take on Aston Martin, Ferrari and Maserati . On the road:\u00a0Bentley bosses believe the two-seater GT grand tourer is just the job to tempt 007 to \u2018defect\u2019 from his big screen affair with Aston Martin stretching over five decades . \u2018It would take a lot of years to get him to defect from Aston Martin. But we\u2019re working on it. Bentley is on track to double its record sales to more than 20,000 on the back of the new 4x4 to be unveiled later this year, before going on sale next year at around \u00a3130,000. Last year Bentley sold a record 11,020 sportily luxurious limousines, coupes and cabriolets. But Bentley expects the new sports utility vehicle to increase sales to 20,000 a year by the end of the decade after hitting 15,000 deliveries by 2018 - and is already expanding its factory to cope with it and other new models. Bentley\u2019s chief executive Wolfgang Duerheimer said last month: \u2018We think the success of the SUV will lift us into a new dimension.\u2019 He added that Bentley would remain British, even if the UK voted to leave the European Union, saying: \u2018The bright future is based in Britain and in Crewe.\u2019 Bentley said more than 4,000 potential customers have already expressed an interest in the new luxury off-roader without having seen it. He added: \u2019There\u2019s a lot we could do. The idea of a fifth line is attractive. We seriously not short of ideas but a small car could be something we could do.\u2019 \u2019The advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against Aston Martin or Maserati.\u2019 However, small will not mean cheap - as prices are expected to range from \u00a3120,000 to \u00a3140,000. Regarding the forthcoming Bentayga 4x4, Mr Rose added: \u2018There\u2019s nothing to say James Bond might not drive a sports utility vehicle.\u2019 Autocar editor-in-chief Steve Cropley said Bentley was out to \u2018steal Aston Martin\u2019s lunch\u2019. He said: \u2019Bentley will unveil a super performance front-engined two-seat sports GT at the Geneva Motor Show. \u2018It is a preview to a new model aimed squarely at stealing sales from Aston Martin and Ferrari.\u2019 He noted: \u2018Bentley is likely to say the car\u2019s main purpose is to test the reaction of potential new customers.\u2019 But Bentley\u2019s well-established track record is to show first, then build later. Mr Cropley said: \u2018The new two-seat coupe would extend Bentley\u2019s product portfolio to five distinct models.\u2019 In the original Ian Fleming books, Bond drove a powerful \u2018blowers\u2019 Bentley with a supercharged engine.

A top of the league clash and a Cup Final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early, and making their way to Wembley. And it was Neil Ashton who opened proceedings with a special Sunday Supplement from Sky Sports' studio high in the stands. There he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here, Oliver Holt. And early in the discussion, Ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon. With a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a Super Sunday that lived up to its billing . Philippe Coutinho scored a fantastic goal for Liverpool in Sky's first game of the day from Anfield . He acknowledged the Capital One Cup was probably 'bottom of the league for top clubs'. But as he then went on to point out, both ten years and today, for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea 'this competition can act as a catalyst'. Well, as it turned out, we'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out. Next up it was Goals On Sunday, during which Chris Kamara very nearly scuppered the Super. During the show, Kammy managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with Ben Shephard, and went exploring. A very entertaining Paul Robinson then told us about a previous Spurs visit to Wembley under Juande Ramos, before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team 'stag do', complete with 'archery, a mock casino... and a shed load of cheese toasties', . During which time Kammy had made his way to the Chelsea dressing room. Here he went on a dizzying tour of the space, where we even got to see the 'tea-making facilities'. So, so far, so good. There was even a great chat with Chelsea kit man Gary Grey who explained that John Terry took his captain's duties so seriously, he was like ' a second kit man'. And that Didier Drogba was a fastidious preparer, who would 'stuff his boots with newspaper'. 'The French paper, L'Equipe', added Gary. Which is where it all started to go wrong. The other guest on the show was Shaun Wright-Phillips, who was also in the dressing room. Reluctantly, he found himself being dragged from his seat by Kammy; 'I don't want to ruin my shoes' muttered the poor fella. To no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy-uppy session which yielded a best total of one. 'You won't see this quality anywhere else', cried Kammy. You'd struggle to argue with that. Luckily, though, the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he'd 'borrowed' from the Bobby Moore Suite to present as a gift to Ben. So at least he'd provided some decent service. The next action came from around 300 miles north of the North Circular with Liverpool welcoming Manchester City to Anfield. Another welcome guest was Gary Neville on Sky Sports' co-commentary who, it has to be said, didn't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the M62. What's more, he carried on not saying it. As the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red, Gary had no sympathy. 'With the experience they have... I'd be embarrassed', he sighed. And he went on, saying it was also 'painful to watch', and that 'I keep seeing the same mistakes being made. (They're) so easy to play against'. Not much Super going on around those parts for Gary, then. Time to head back to Wembley, where host Simon Thomas and his excellent trio of Jamie Redknapp, Glenn Hoddle and Thierry Henry not only had the run of Wembley, but also a seeming age to fill before kick off. There also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that wouldn't play fair, and a stadium PA system they could probably hear back up at Anfield. It all made for a painful build-up. John Terry fires the ball home via a deflection off Eric Dier to put Chelsea in front at Wembley . After the game at Anfield Sky headed back to Wembley to see Tottenham's failed quest for the League Cup . Gary Neville was critical of Manchester City after their 'embarrassing' defeat to Liverpool at lunch time . For their cup final coverage Sky put together a team of Glenn Hoddle, Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp . Hoddle kept Henry focused on football as the ex-Arsenal man put in his best peformance since joining Sky . Luckily, though, the boys decamped at kick-off to the studio where the day had begun. Where as the game got under way, things started to get back to nudging Super. All of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited Chelsea gaffer, who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride. 'I've never seen him so happy', said Jamie. Even if on interview he was a little more the familiar Jose. 'Celebrations', he agreed were in order, but 'in 20 minutes, over. Goodbye. Training tomorrow'. Things were back to normal for the pundits, too. What's more, I think this was also the best we've seen of Henry since his formal arrival at Sky Sports. With the insightful experience of Hoddle on one side, and the encouraging cajoling of Jamie on the other, Thierry was sharp, punchy and keen as mustard to talk football. With Jamie steering him through from a (thankfully) fully functioning TV monitor, his dissection of Diego Costa's goal was nigh on a masterclass. 'If I'm the striker there', he enthused. 'Happy days!'. Which indeed it was, in the end.

Lin had looked as though he was destined for a career as a journeyman. He was struggling to make it to the big time. NBA teams had turned their backs on him until the Knicks were forced to give him a chance. Lin, who was struggling financially and sleeping on a friend\u2019s couch, played well in his first match. And his second. And his third. He outscored his more illustrious team-mates. The struggling Knicks embarked on a winning streak. Harry Kane's meteoric rise continued on Friday when he marked his first England game with a goal . Kane headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing Wayne Rooney . Kane's progress is reminiscient of Jeremy Lin's form when he was playing basketball for the New York Knicks . Lin propelled the Knicks to a winning streak but failed to recapture his form after sustaining an injury . By the end of the first week, celebrities were flocking to courtside at Madison Square Garden to catch the buzz. Lin became a phenomenon and the mania that developed around him was given a name: Linsanity. It seemed then that Lin could never again return to ordinariness. But in mid-March, the coach who had given him his chance was fired and Lin sustained a knee injury that ended his season. He was traded to another team in the summer. They offloaded him to the struggling Los Angeles Lakers, where he has also failed to make an impact. He is known now only for his failure to sustain Linsanity. \u2018I feel like I\u2019m back to square one,\u2019 he said last week. You get the point? Well, you would have done if you had been at Wembley on Friday night, heard the deafening, rumbling cheer that rolled around the stadium when Harry Kane ran on to make his England debut and witnessed the scenes when, 79 seconds later, he scored with a far-post header. This is English football\u2019s Linsanity. In the middle of what is, in many ways, a fairly unremarkable domestic football season, we have become caught up in our very own intoxicating, uplifting kind of madness. \u2018It\u2019s nice when fairytales come true,\u2019 said the England manager Roy Hodgson afterwards, beaming into the camera. Kane beamed, too. \u2018It\u2019s the start that I dreamed of,\u2019 he said. The Lithuania manager, Igoris Pankratjevas, described the Spurs forward as a \u2018sniper\u2019. Even Wayne Rooney, whose limelight had been stolen by the 21-year-old, seemed a little breathless. \u2018It\u2019s incredible really,\u2019 Rooney said of Kane\u2019s impact. \u2018You can feel the excitement all around the country.\u2019 And so a kid who looked like he might be heading for a career in the lower divisions is suddenly taking our league, and now our national team, by storm. What is unfolding in front of us seems so wonderfully unlikely that it has reached the point where it is scarcely credible. Late on Friday night, the BBC displayed a map of the world showing where social media reaction to Kane\u2019s goal had been at its height. The yellow dots showing maximum interaction were spread from England to Indonesia to Mexico to Japan and Brazil. Wayne Rooney (right) praised Kane's impact with Tottenham and now at international level . Kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for England against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday . Kane was sent on loan to a number of football league sides before breaking through to the Tottenham side . This is a kid who was shunted around the lower leagues to Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester while Spurs tried to work out what to do with him and whether he was good enough to make the grade with them. This is a kid, an English kid, a local north London kid, whose meteoric rise has coincided with immigration leaping to the top of the political agenda and concerns about the proliferation of foreign players and owners in our leagues. When Spurs fans sing that Kane is \u2018one of our own\u2019, their boast represents not just a celebration of his talent but a lament for a time when they could identify more closely with the players they were watching. In an age where teams are being taken away from the fans, Kane represents a reconnection. The mania that has grown around him is a warning that there are those who harbour misgivings about the cosmopolitan make-up of the Premier League. Riding along on Kane\u2019s coat-tails, FA chairman Greg Dyke has quickly and adroitly tapped into those fears and prejudices and seized the moment to propose that every Premier League club should have 12 home-grown players in its 25-man squad. Kane is at the centre of all this but as he walked triumphantly from the pitch on Friday night, the next question is how long can he maintain this trajectory? Is this his natural orbit, is he here to stay or is this, like Linsanity, some brief enchantment? The media, of course, is already being accused of building a kid up just so it can knock him down but Kane is fortunate that in his club boss, Mauricio Pochettino, and Hodgson, he has two managers who will shepherd him wisely. \u2018We\u2019re not going to hold him back,\u2019 said Hodgson. \u2018There\u2019s no question of that. But on the other hand, I am rather hoping I have got Harry Kane for a long period to come and I don\u2019t want to be the one who throws him in and he flies too close to the sun.\u2019 Did the England manager give any thought to the idea that Kane might fall back into the shadows? \u2018I suppose when someone has shone quite so brilliantly, that is always in the back of your mind,\u2019 Hodgson said. \u2018But I have got to say that from what I have seen of him, from what I know of the apprenticeship he has already served, when I look at the qualities he possesses as a football player, I have got no fears in that respect. I don\u2019t believe it will happen. Roy Hodgson believes that Kane will be able to maintain his astonishing standard of form . Kane is in line to feature for England in a friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday . England manager Hodgson is pleased with how Kane is being handled at Tottenham by Mauricio Pochettino . \u2018I still think it is prudent for Mauricio Pochettino and myself, as the England manager, not to stand here in front of you singing his praises. You are singing his praises enough, so just allow me to dampen them down a little bit.\u2019 It probably won\u2019t do much good. The Kane Train is setting off for Turin on Tuesday, full steam ahead.

Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into\u00a0hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss. Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms. Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through. 'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.' In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met. 'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.'

Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later . However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away. They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high. Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said\u00a0'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.' 'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up. A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead. Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone. 'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.' The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. Paisley and Erica are still in the hospital where Mr Morales goes every day, while his mother-in-law cares for Carlos Jr. and Tracey at home.

England must win both matches, against lower-ranked opponents, to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage. An early exit looms large after Sunday's nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in Wellington followed wide-margin beatings by co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Joe Root has insisted that England must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games . Root snicks a ball down fine leg during England's defeat by Sri Lanka in their previous World Cup match . That has piled the pressure on, albeit in two games Root points out that England would have needed to win in any circumstance. 'If you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them,' Root said. 'The way our schedule is, we have these games towards the end. If it was broken up a bit more it might look slightly different. 'But it doesn't take away from the fact that we want to win these two games convincingly.' England's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last-eight they will now most likely play the highest-ranked team in Pool B. That will almost certainly be either South Africa or world champions India, who England did beat twice during the Tri-Series leading up to the World Cup. 'We don't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we've got wrong so far,' Root added. England captain Eoin Morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the World Cup . Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket wi . 'We know that if we get through to the quarter-finals we'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose. 'There will be sides coming up against us who could potentially be quite timid and think they should beat us and that could work in our favour. 'By the time you get to that stage it's crunch time and every side is under pressure; not just us. Hopefully we can get those wins and build some momentum.' Root believes the gap between England and the best teams at the World Cup is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest. 'I don't think that's fair,' he said. 'Yes, we have been beaten heavily in those three games, but I don't think that we are that far away from beating those sides. 'If we get the best out of every individual and all play as well as we can then we are just as good as sides like that if not better. It's about making sure, for the next two games especially, that we turn up and do everything we possibly can to put those performances in. 'That's got to come from the individuals to make sure they front up. Not just the senior players; not just exciting young players coming into the side. From everyone.' Root hit a career-best 121 from 108 balls against Sri Lanka but England's bowlers couldn't match his exploits . Steven Finn and James Taylor show their disappointment after England's third loss of the tournament . Root stood up to be counted in the Sri Lanka defeat when the 24-year-old became England's young World Cup centurion. His career-best 121 from 108 balls inspired England to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara eased Sri Lanka to victory in 16 balls. 'At the start of the day, if you'd given us 310 we'd have thought that a very good effort,' Root said. 'Whenever you get 310 on the board you are immediately putting sides under pressure to chase it. Unfortunately we didn't create that pressure with the ball and we didn't do anything to make it difficult for them from 10 overs onwards.' The ease of Sri Lanka's chase suggested England did not set their sights high enough and, while Root admitted more risks can be taken with the bat, they had left Sri Lanka with a record chase at the ground. 'There was no feeling turning up to the game that 270 was a par score,' he said. 'We got out there, we played it as we saw it, there were periods when Sri Lanka bowled really well at us. We got 310 which, on that wicket, I felt was a good score. 'In one-day cricket maybe we could have taken a few more risks, potentially we could have gone a bit earlier at them, be more aggressive earlier. But it's a fine balance. If you then lose two wickets - on that wicket, we'd done well to get to where we were. 'Unfortunately we couldn't quite create the pressure with the ball that they did. We weren't disciplined enough and we leaked too many boundaries.'", "label": 0.4464285857975483, "predicted": 0.36784684658050537}, "126": {"text": "(CNN)Israel has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one-fifth of its country's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat. We were born into the wrong tribe, so to speak. Campaign season shed light on the troubling reality in Israel -- that tribalism trumps democracy and ethnicity trumps citizenship. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Arabs were \"being bused to the polling station in droves,\" people around the world were justifiably horrified. And Monday, in response to the outrage, he apologized for his statement, offering that he knew his comments \"offended members of the Israeli Arab community.\" But Netanyahu's policies speak much more loudly than his half-apology. And with him poised to serve a fourth term, many Palestinian citizens of Israel fear, with good reason, that his victory means it is open season for anti-Arab racism in the Knesset and in the streets. Israel's war on its Palestinian citizens is nothing new; our rights have been under attack for years (imagine a proposal that forced Jewish Americans to sign a \"loyalty oath\" to the United States as was proposed for Palestinians and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel). However, the majority's attempt to further entrench institutionalized racism and deny the rights of indigenous Palestinians has achieved frightening momentum. The controversial \"Jewish Nation-State Bill\" that previously floundered in the Knesset has been resurrected. The bill, if passed, would codify the principle of preserving a Jewish ethnic majority. There are versions of it that establish Hebrew as the sole official language and recognize Jewish religious law as a \"source of inspiration for the Knesset.\" Even Israel's Supreme Court has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights, which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its Jewish citizens. In response, the government changed the Supreme Court's composition to tilt it further to the right. Today, the sole Arab Supreme Court justice, Salim Jubran, very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to Israel's Palestinian citizens.

The 2011 Admissions Committees Law \u2014 upheld in 2014 by the more conservative  Supreme Court, which includes the first Israeli settler jurist \u2014 allows hundreds of localities in Israel to essentially reject applicants seeking to buy homes built on state land because the applicants are deemed \"unsuitable.\"  The law caused an outcry among Palestinian citizens and human rights groups, who assert that it's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against Israeli citizens on the basis of ethnicity. Simply put, the law enforces segregation within Israel, helping to keep Palestinian citizens out of Jewish communities. Attempts to marginalize Palestinian citizens of Israel also extend to the political sphere. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's successful push to raise the threshold required to win seats in the Knesset was a move designed to exclude Palestinian lawmakers. Ironically, that move backfired, prompting four Arab parties to create the Arab Joint List, whose members span a wide ideological spectrum. Despite their political differences, they were united by one important mission, and that was to defend the rights of Palestinians, whether they reside within Israel or in the occupied territories. The Joint List won 13 seats and took third place in the parliamentary election. While their unity and strong showing is encouraging in the face of Israeli efforts to divide and weaken the Palestinian community, the fact that they were forced to unite on the basis of ethnicity rather than ideology is a reflection of Israeli politics, which draws boundaries among its citizens on the basis of ethnicity and religion and openly participates in ugly, xenophobic electioneering. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The Greek philosopher Aristotle once said that the essence of democracy is \"to rule and be ruled in turn,\" but as Hassan Jabareen, head of Adalah: The Legal Center for Minority Rights in Israel, puts it, in Israel, \"Arabs are always ruled and Arab citizens are always in the opposition, never in the coalition, no matter how many seats they win.\" It is very telling that Netanyahu could well form his coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, who called for beheading disloyal Arab citizens of Israel and whose party Yisrael Beiteinu only won six seats in the Knesset, and not with the Arab Joint List, which won more than twice as many seats and is calling for equality and an end to Israel's military occupation of Palestinian lands, which has lasted nearly half a century. If Netanyahu's re-election is an ill omen for the Palestinian citizens of Israel, it is even worse news for the 4.5 million Palestinians under occupation who are ruled by a state that denies them all rights. When Netanyahu said on the eve of the election that he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state, he was making it clear that the occupation will continue as long as he remains in power. Opinion: The danger of Netanyahu's win . Renouncing Palestinian statehood rallied Netanyahu's base by reminding them of how much he has done to preserve and extend Israel's grip on its West Bank settlements, built in violation of international law and considered illegitimate by official U.S. policy going back decades. In fact, blocking the creation of a Palestinian state has been Netanyahu's life's work. Over the years, he has rhetorically \"accepted\" Palestinian statehood while continuing to steal the very land that would comprise a Palestinian state. The lip service he has paid to Palestinian statehood and his desire to return to the bankrupt \"peace process\" has provided him with a useful smokescreen behind which he continues to actively realize the vision he revealed in his recent political campaign when he ruled out a two-state solution -- a vision of a greater Israel where Palestinians live under apartheid rule, without a state and without equal rights . The policies that Israel's electorate has chosen are directly at odds with U.S. interests, not to mention American values. Citizens around the world, including in the United States, are increasingly frustrated with Israel's treatment of Palestinians and its role in helping to fuel armed conflict in the region, as demonstrated by its current effort to scuttle U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. Netanyahu is expecting to attempt to resume business as usual with Washington, offering occasional platitudes about peace in exchange for the freedom to deepen the occupation and strip away the rights of Israel's Palestinian citizens. Given what is at stake, it will be dangerous for America -- and for Israel -- if President Obama plays along.", "label": 0.0, "predicted": 0.3485187292098999}, "127": {"text": "A youth football coach used his job to groom boys by inviting them to matches and sending them naked photographs on social media. Kane Hutchison, 25, was found guilty of inciting two teenage boys to engage in sexual activity on the internet. The abuse came to light after the mothers of the two boys, aged 13 and 14, recognised Hutchison, from Gateshead, following a conviction last year. In August 2014, he was jailed for three years for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy after offering to take him to watch a football match. He invited a youngster to attend an away match between Gateshead and Macclesfield last April and asked him to stay at his house so they could get an 'early start.' Hutchison forced the boy to share a bed and then molested him. The boy told his mother and he was arrested, hiding in the loft, and prosecuted. The latest conviction relates to a series of offences, between the summers of 2013-14. The first victim knew Hutchison played for a football club in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and was looking into joining the same club. Predator: Football coach Kane Huctchison pictured outside court and showing his love of football (right). He was convicted of inciting two teenage boys to engage in sexual activity in Gateshead . Hutchison made contact with the boy on Facebook, where he was advertising for players, and they began to communicate. Prosecutor Alec Burns said: 'From the defendant's point of view the communication became more and more sexual. 'He told him he could earn money making pornographic films, he said \u00a3350 an hour. He asked (the boy) to send pictures of himself.' The boy told police Hutchison had communicated with him on 'face tag' and appeared on his computer screen via a webcam committing a sex act on himself. He encouraged the victim to do the same and made him swap intimate pictures. Hutchison also tried to meet the youngster in a car park, the court heard. Hutchison targeted another boy, aged 14, in a similar way between April and August last year. He lied about his age and started asking the youngster to meet him, offering him \u00a320 to do so. He also sent him intimate pictures of himself on Facebook and Snapchat and encouraged him to do the same. It came to light when the boy's mother  recognised him as one of her son's Facebook friends. Hutchison denied two counts of sexual assault but was found guilty after a trial. He\u00a0can now be identified after a reporting ban was lifted. Nick Lane, defending, said Hutchison had already had his FA licence, to teach children, revoked. At the time of his arrest, he was working for a football magazine, he said. 'He is a man who in the past has done considerable charity work and good work for the community,' he said. 'In 2013 he was part of a team raising money for Help for Heroes who over the course of 24 hours visited 20 Premier League grounds as a way of raising funds for that charity. 'He has used his football contacts in the past to organise a charity match for testicular cancer. 'He has also in the past used his sporting skills working with adults with learning difficulties to encourage them to participate in sport.' The trial heard Hutchison had been 'struggling with his sexuality' at the time and has been on a sex offender programme in prison. Sentence was adjourned  until next month although Judge John Evans warned it would be a custodial sentence. He said: 'Having been convicted of these offences I'm going to adjourn sentence now for a pre-sentence report to address the issue of dangerousness. 'You know only a custodial sentence can follow in relation to these matters.'", "label": 0.2613636441528797, "predicted": 0.676347017288208}, "128": {"text": "Danny Welbeck may have scored the goal that put his former club out of the FA Cup, but he was not the only former Old Trafford star who was on target on Monday night. On an evening where Manchester United lacked creativity and firepower, three players they have let go in recent years scored around Europe to win their side crucial matches. To add to Arsenal striker Welbeck's triumphant Old Trafford return, on loan winger Nani - deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal - and French midfielder Paul Pogba scored for their clubs. Danny Welbeck slots home the winning goal after rounding David de Gea at Old Trafford on Monday . Welbeck celebrated passionately after scoring the goal that knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup . Welbeck was one of three former United players who netted vital goals on the same evening . Pogba, who was allowed to leave United by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 after failing to sign a contract with the club, scored a stunning volley from the edge of the box to give Juventus a 1-0 win over Sassuolo. The 82nd-minute goal put the 'Old Lady' 11 points clear at the top of Serie A, and keeps them on course for a fourth straight title. In Portugal it was Nani - still technically a United player - who popped up for the winning goal for Sporting Lisbon in their 3-2 win over Panafiel. Paul Pogba unleashes a superb 82nd minute volley which won Juventus the game against Sassuolo . The Frenchman used to be at United, but was allowed to leave after playing just three league games . Pogba has become a vital part of a Juventus side on course to win yet another Italian title this season . Van Gaal has reportedly not spoken to the Portuguese winger since he was allowed to leave Old Trafford, but Nani showed he still has the quality to make the difference when it matters. Down to ten men, Sporting had let a two-goal lead slip before Nani arrived to score a diving header and secure all three points against the Portuguese league's bottom side. The win keeps Nani's side in the hunt to qualify for next season's Champions League, something Van Gaal's United look increasingly unlikely to do. But none of those will hurt as much as Danny Welbeck's strike on Monday night, which was not only another winner from an ex-United player, but also against his former club. Nani celebrates after scoring the winner for 10-man Sporting Lisbon in a 3-2 win over Penafiel . The Portuguese winger was allowed to leave on loan after Louis van Gaal decided he was not needed . Unlike the Frenchman Pogba or the Portuguese Nani, Welbeck is a product of United's academy. But after Van Gaal deemed him not good enough for Old Trafford - preferring expensive flop Radamel Falcao to warm the subs bench - the 24-year-old proved he can still score at the Theatre of Dreams. On Monday, United could have done with the composure, bravery and quality shown by Welbeck, Nani and Pogba - but all three had been allowed  to leave.

Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager\u00a0Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Respect: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left. Police chief Selami Alt\u0131nok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. Standing guard:\u00a0Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters:\u00a0Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse . Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police . Gunshots: According to the\u00a0Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul.

The Steel Valley School Board voted unanimously without discussion on Thursday night to reject the complaint, according the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In the grievance filed February 13, the teachers union said allowing ten-year-old Kaitlin Montgomery to use the restroom on the lower level of Park Elementary School in Munhall violated the teachers' contract. The teachers union at Park Elementary School in Munhall, Pennsylvania, filed a grievance about Kaitlin Montgomery (left), pictured with her mother Tracy Montgomery (right), because she was using the faculty restroom on the school's lower level which violated their contracts . Kaitlin, a fourth grader, has chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and foot problems, and is also autistic. There are no student bathrooms on the school's lower level, where Kaitlin's classroom is located . The grievance's solution was that Kaitlin would have had to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use the student bathroom . Eighteen female teachers, including two special education teachers, signed a petition that accompanied the grievance against the fourth grader, who has chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and foot problems and is also autistic. The Steel Valley Education Association said the contract requires the district to provide 'lavatory facilities exclusively for employees', according to the\u00a0Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'The bathrooms that have been designated as faculty bathrooms shall be exclusively used by the faculty,' the grievance said. The student's mother, Tracy Montgomery, told the board on Thursday that before she got permission to have her daughter use the faculty restroom, school officials said the girl would have to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use a student bathroom, which is what other students have to do. Kaitlin can't walk long distances, so her family uses a custom-made stroller for easier transportation. Because of her physical disabilities, Kaitlin cannot walk long distances and her family uses a custom-made stroller for transportation . Montgomery said that this is just one of Kaitlin's many issues at the school. Because there is no elevator from the school's lower level to the top levels, her daughter is unable to access the music and art rooms for classes . Montgomery found out about the grievance through a Post-Gazette article, after which she said she was 'embarrassed for the teachers and appalled. Steel Valley Education Association President Shawn McCallister said the grievance wasn't filed to prevent the student from using the restroom, the Post-Gazette reported, but to create 'a better outcome for all involved'. District Superintendent Ed Wehrer previously said federal law requires Steel Valley to meet the needs of students with disabilities. No other alternatives met the girl's needs, he said, and noted that the student is the only non-faculty member using the restroom. The school board said no alternatives to the faculty restroom met Kaitlin's needs, so she would be allowed into the bathroom, being the only non-faculty member using the facilities . The school board voted unanimously without discussion on Thursday night to allow Kaitlin to use the faculty bathroom . District official Diane Borges, who oversees pupil personnel and special services, had said the restroom on the lower level of the school in Munhall is the only one available. Another one located in a special education room is now taken up by a ventilation unit, according to WTAE. Borges said that two other faculty restrooms are in the school building and that she believes the district accommodations fulfill the teachers' contract. Montgomery said that this is only one of many problems Kaitlin faces in her school, saying that the lower level annex is two floors below the building elevator, so she won't be able to get to classes on higher levels including music and art.

A spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, Zaeem Qadri, condemned the attacks but said it was unfortunate the mob had killed the two suspects rather than turning them over to police. He added authorities are reinforcing security at the 481 remaining churches across the city. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a Pakistani Taliban splinter group, claimed responsibility for the blasts and said it was the work of two suicide bombers. The Pakistani Taliban  vowed to continue their campaign for the enforcement of Sharia law. Area hospitals were flooded with casualties and scenes of mourning. Shaheen Bibi's 10-year-old son Abhishak was among those killed. Two police officers who were protecting the church were also killed in the explosions. 'My son had gone to the church to pray for a good result in his examinations,' Ms Bibi said as she cried. 'He wanted me to sew him some new clothes if he passed his examinations.' Christians took to the streets, setting fire to cars in a show of defiance in the country's second largest city . Pakistani Christians burn a cart in protest against attacks which targeted the churches at their peak period . One witness told Pakistan's Geo television that the main gate to one of the churches targeted was closed so people were using a smaller gate. 'One bomber exploded himself near that gate, that created chaos and during the course there was another blast,' he said. In the tense aftermath, the mood quickly turned violent. Local television footage showed an angry crowd beating a person they thought was connected to the attack, while others attacked buses in the city. The blasts, in a majority Christian suburb of the eastern city, went off in quick succession at a busy time when worshippers were attending Sunday morning prayers. Pastor David, a local cleric at the site, said: 'One blast took place at the entrance of one church where a congregation was going on. 'Another blast took place in the second church,'\u00a0adding that the two buildings were 500 metres (1,600 feet) apart. Witnesses reported that quick action by a security guard prevented many more deaths - but the guard is also among those dead.

'I rushed towards the spot and saw the security guard scuffle with a man who was trying to enter the church, after failing, he blew himself up. 'I saw his body parts flying through the air.' Mr Masih said the security guard died in the blast, but did not know if the first blast was also a suicide bomber. Nabila Ghazanfar, a spokeswoman for the police, told AFP that a state of emergency has been imposed in the city's hospitals as the death toll was expected to rise. Meanwhile, hundreds of Christians took to the streets to protest against the police and the lack of proper security at the churches. Militants in Pakistan have attacked Christians and other religious minorities many times over the years.

But Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, is generally considered peaceful. However, violence there has been increasing after the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the Taliban last year. After these failed, the military launched an offensive in the remote northwestern region of North Waziristan along the Afghan border to push the Taliban from the last major region they controlled. Lahore is the capital of Punjab, Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province as well as the political heartland of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who criticised the attack. A statement carried by state media said: 'Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif ed the Lahore blasts and directed provincial governments to ensure the security of public and their properties.' Pope Francis also condemned the attacks, departing from his scripted remarks in his customary address today to decry the 'persecution' of Christians. He told crowds at\u00a0St. Peter's Square in the Vatican that he prayed for peace in the country and that 'this persecution of Christians, and that the world tries to hide it, finishes'. 'These are Christian churches. Christians are persecuted, our brothers spill their blood simply because they are Christians,' he added.

Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as the killer in the infamous ISIS beheading videos last week - carried out the kidnap during his days living on a notorious housing estate. He and two bearded associates are said to have abducted two gang members accused of beating up his younger brother, Omar, in 2008. Mohammed Emwazi (left) - now unmasked as ISIS killer Jihadi John - reportedly kidnapped two schoolboys and threatened them with a gun after his younger brother Omar (right) was attacked  in 2008 . The brothers were living on the Mozart estate in west London at the time of the incident, which was known for its postcode gang 'the Mozart Bloods'. A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face. When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said. He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. 'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.' A former friend of Omar Emwazi say boys who assaulted him and Omar were dumped on the M1 motorway without their clothes in revenge for the violent attack (file picture) Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week . The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'. Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed. He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi \u2013 a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended. It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Emwazi's former home (pictured) was on the Mozart estate in west London known for its postcode gang . Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted. Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films. It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria. The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause. Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists. On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes. At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions. A BBC journalist gives a live update from outside the home of Mohammed Emwazi last week. The corporation has defended itself against claims it 'glamorised' the ISIS killer . The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story. But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation. We don't believe that our coverage has glamorised him or Islamic State. 'We have made it very clear that he appears to be responsible for a number of brutal killings, and is a member of a growing, well-armed, well-financed organisation that commits acts of brutality and is having a profound impact on the security of the Middle East.

The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city. Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden and he must avoid being hit by the sniper rounds heard popping and cracking in the background. Scroll down for video . Jihadi:\u00a0The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city . Radical: The British Al Qaeda fighter says that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood' Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as Nusra Front - a branch of Al Qaeda operating in Syria. He is not thought to be fighting for the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS. Described as 'A short reminder from the blessed land of Shaam', the propaganda footage is clearly designed to advertise the sacrifices Al Qaeda members are making in the name of their religion. The clip begins with a short burst of religious chanting before cutting to HD-footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the Al Qaeda-affiliated militants and soldiers fighting on behalf of the Syrian regime. 'It's a foggy, cold day. The enemy is quite close and you can hear their shots coming - heavy machine gun fire,' the jihadi says, as the crack and pop of AK47 rounds ring out in the background. 'That is fitnah of the head,' he adds, using an Arabic word meaning distress or mentally challenging. He adds that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood'. Conflict: The clip begins with  HD-footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the Al Qaeda militants and soldiers of the Syrian regime . Heavily armed: Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden . Professional:\u00a0Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra . The video is the first to be uploaded to a YouTube account titled 'Brit in Shaam', which suggests it may well be part of a series of Al Qaeda propaganda releases featuring the fighter. The use of high-definition cameras and the use of a British fighter apes the professionally shot and edited video releases by the Islamic State terror group - which have included the sickening filmed beheadings of several Western hostages, including two Britons. In the Al Qaeda release, the militant is seen standing up in the trench, saying 'From time to time you have to keep peering up. The only problem is if you stick your head up for too long, a sniper can take your head out'. 'Of course we all want shahada [martyrdom] but we can't be reckless about these things. If it comes it comes but the priority of the mujahideen is to protect his life and stand guard,' he adds. The militant goes on to add that 'while villages and towns in that direction live their ordinary lives, we are here on the frontline, the mujahideen Alhamdulillah [thanks be to God]'. One of at least four airmen captured by Al Qaeda militants after their Syrian Air Force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric. The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province, is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle. Al-Muhaysini, who has long been affiliated with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria, suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the Syrian regime releases notorious jihadi\u00a0Abu Mus'ab as-Suri, who is wanted in Spain for suspected links to the 1985 El Descanso and 2004 Madrid bombings. Fear: The captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle . The video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra behind him. Clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash, the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head. The footage is decidedly amateur, is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick, professionally edited videos put out by Nusra's rival jihadi group Islamic State. Nevertheless, the sight of Al-Muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any ISIS release. 'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed in Jabal al-Zawiya yesterday . Al-Muhaysini's primary demand is that the Syrian regime release\u00a0Abu Mus'ab as-Suri - a notorious Al Qaeda linked militant who was arrested in Pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland. Aleppo-born As-Suri - who holds Spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in Spain on suspicion of taking part in the Islamic Jihad Organization's 1985 bombing at Madrid's El Descanso restaurant, which left 18 dead.

Mourinho made the comments ahead of Wednesday night's crucial Champions League last-16 clash at Stamford Bridge after a feisty 1-1 draw in the first leg. He said: 'I was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls. Jose Mourinho says Paris Saint-Germain are the most aggressive team Chelsea have played this season .

'This season we've played against sides form the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG.' Eden Hazard was often the victim at the Parc des Princes, though Laurent Blanc has also claimed Diego Costa is capable of 'dirty tricks' and has told the referee to watch out. It promises to be a tough night for Bjorn Kuipers. Not only with PSG, but with Chelsea - who have committed more fouls than PSG in the competition this season - and Nemanja Matic, whose foul-count is higher than any of Blanc's players.

Graceful, skillful, blessed with flair; those are the characteristics usually associated with Brazilian footballers... but not these two defenders. Their rugged approach against Chelsea in the first leg angered the visiting players. That was especially case with former Blues defender Luiz. The unconventional centre back was obviously eager to make a point to Mourinho, who sold him for a staggering fee of \u00a350million in the summer. Luiz operated in midfield in Paris and clattered into Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, as well as going head-to-head with Costa. He is set to operate further back on Wednesday night, so will look to join forces with Thiago Silva and get on Costa's nerves again. Luiz and Thiago Silva (right, sporting a black eye) will be looking to dominate Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge . Luiz tugs back Fabregas (left) and squares up to Costa (right) during the first leg . Marco Verratti . In a midfield three that usually sees tough-tacklers Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi surround him, Verratti - who has been compared to Andrea Pirlo - is often looked at as the 'nice guy'. But the Italian youngster showed he had a bit of the Paul Scholes about him as he launched into tackles against Chelsea last month. One in particular, on Hazard once again, should have resulted in a red card for the 22-year-old. His passing range and balance on the ball is something to be admired, but Oscar, Willian and Hazard should be wary of more late lunges from Verratti and co. Marco Verratti is not known for his tackling ability but could have seen red for this challenge on Hazard . The Italian midfielder went in with his studs up and caught Hazard over the top of the ball . Zlatan Ibrahimovic . 'Even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player \u2013 came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering,' Mourinho claimed in his press conference on Tuesday. The controversial striker may not be regarded as much of a team player and rarely defends from the front with his running, but it is evident he will do what it takes to win. The Swede has been sent off 10 times in his club career, with offences including slapping a player in the face.

'My late husband, Desmond, used to sing it to me when he had to leave, but as he was completely tone-deaf, we used to dissolve into laughter, and that eased the pain and gave us a joyous memory, until we met again. \u2018And Up, Up and Away [by The Fifth Dimension] always reminds me of the balloon flight he gave me as a birthday gift, when I flew so fast in a beautiful balloon that we landed with a crash in a bramble bush.

Now the trio are to appear on a new documentary called OAPs Behaving Badly, a Channel 5 series that follows the nation\u2019s craziest pensioners. The trio's party plans swung into action as soon as they retired, with Christine and Sheila joining June in Tenerife for a huge party to mark her retirement. The riotous trip to the Spanish holiday island included nights out\u00a0wearing comedy wigs and boobs, plastic penis noses, and flirtations with much younger male holidaymakers. Innocent: June, seen here in an everyday ensemble, likes to zip between bars on her mobility scooter . Getting ready: Although the trio like to go out in Barnsley, they save their biggest parties for holidays . Unusual look: Christine (far right) says she wore a prostitute's outfit for her son's 40th birthday party . 'On holiday no man is ever safe because I can guarantee I always feel somebody\u2019s bottom or something else,' explained Christine, a grandmother of three. ;My behaviour is a bit erotic sometimes. If I\u2019ve had a drink especially.' But husband Tony, 67, doesn\u2019t mind being left behind or his wife\u2019s flirty behaviour and indulges in several solo weeks in Spain himself. According to Christine, \u2018What happens in Tenerife, stay in Tenerife\u2019, with all three ladies happy to make the most of their time abroad. 'When I went to Tenerife for my son\u2019s 40th I got dressed up as a hooker,' reveals Christine, admitting she got into trouble with a local woman, who thought she was a rival escort invading her patch. Leading the charge: Christine is the ringleader and says 'no man is safe' when she is out and about . Propping up the bar: The trio have long been fans of wild all-night parties . Apologies: June says the trio often have to apologise when they return to bars following a booze-fuelled night . Just as excitable is June who rides a mobility scooter as a result of having had 10 leg operations. Not that she has any plans to slow down. 'When she gets on that scooter, you\u2019ve got to watch out because you\u2019re never safe,' says Christine. 'She can be a tearaway when she gets speeding on that scooter.' But despite her tearaway nickname, June says Christine is the wildest of the group. 'Once we\u2019ve been somewhere, we\u2019re never forgotten. 'We go back for the second time and we have to apologise for what Christine\u2019s done the first time.'", "label": 0.15909091383218765, "predicted": 0.4193633794784546}, "141": {"text": "One of the 'naive and impressionable' teenage boys who was stopped in Turkey as he tried to join ISIS had written cruel jibes about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby on social media, it has emerged. The 17-year-old boy, an A-grade student from Brent, north west London, was stopped at Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport in Istanbul with his 17-year-old cousin and another 19-year-old man on Saturday. It has now been revealed that prior to him fleeing Britain, he made comments on social media criticising the 'eruption' of public grief over the Islamist murder of solder Rigby, who was brutally killed near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south east London in May 2013. Scroll down for video . One of the 17-year-old boys who was detained in Turkey alongside his 17-year-old cousin and another 19-year-old man (pictured being stopped at the airport) had written jibes about the murder of Lee Rigby online . The teenage boy apparently made cruel jibes about the Islamist murder of solider Lee Rigby (pictured), who was brutally killed by fanatics near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, southeast London in May 2013 . The sixth form student also spoke online about 'not being able to recognise' himself from the person he had been a year earlier. A friend of the boy has now spoken about his fears that the teenager was radicalised by an older pupil at the school. The source told The Sun: 'His radical views were well known. He fell in with a boy and was influenced by his extreme views. 'He was extremely bright and wanted to go to university to study engineering. 'On Friday when he went missing, he told people he was going to prayers. His parents were distraught.' It is understood that one of the teenagers attended Preston Manor School in Wembley, where students were recently told that weekly prayer sessions must be taken only in English amid fears of radicalisation. Pupils claimed that as part of the new requirements, a teacher must also be present at all times during prayers. The three teenagers, who have not been named, were intercepted by officials after the shocked families of the younger boys learned of their plans and quickly alerted police, who waited at the airport as the flight landed from Barcelona, Spain. The teens, all from Brent, north west London, were stopped at Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport in Istanbul when an officer checked their passports  and ordered for them to be taken to a 'risk and analysis' centre . It is believed they travelled from mainland Spain to try and dodge being caught. However, they were stopped as they went through passport control at the Turkish airport after landing at about 11pm on Saturday. CCTV footage shows an immigration officer checking the passports of each of the teenage boys before telling them they will not be able to proceed to the arrivals hall. They are then escorted to a 'risk and analysis centre' in the airport by officials. All three teenagers were later put on a return flight to London and taken into custody at a high-security police station for questioning. They have since been released on bail after being quizzed by counter-terror officers on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Yesterday, it emerged that one of the boys had asked the council when he could return to school. The two younger teenage boys were at a meeting with Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, when the question arose. Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, spoke to the teenagers and their families this week and does not believe they were radicalised but 'naive' Mr Butt told Channel 4 News: 'One of them was saying to me \"when can I go back to school?\" 'I said to him I think you have to wait a little bit longer to let things settle down and we can work with the school and everyone else and make sure things are right for you to go back.' Mr Butt, who met with the teenagers and their families, said both of the boys had been behaving normally prior to disappearing. He said: 'The children had no conversations about any kind of radical speak or anything else, the conversations were absolutely normal. 'One of the boys had a conversation with his father the night before and the father had asked him do you want some pocket money? 'The father gave him \u00a320 and the child gave him \u00a310 back. If someone is preparing to go somewhere I think you would take as much money with you as possible. And for him to give \u00a310 back doesn't suggest he had anything prepared or was going to do anything wrong.' The politician said he believed that they had been 'caught up in emotions' rather than radicalised and were 'naive' teenagers who had made a mistake and were relieved to come home. He said: 'Personally I don't think they had been radicalised, absolutely not. I think what they've done is they've been caught up in emotions as such. 'They were looking for a platform to speak up or to say something and they haven't found a space or a platform where they can have a grown up conversation about events in Syria. 'I met with the two boys. I met with the two families as well and you could not meet a more normal family. The two young kids they are grade A students and both of them have aspirations, one to be an engineer and one to be a doctor. 'It just beggars belief these guys got caught up in their own thinking as such, of trying to go out there and do some good. All they've said from the conversations I have with them is that they wanted to go out there and help.' In light of the recent claims that one of the boys held extremist views before fleeing the country, Mr Butt issued a fresh statement today in which he said: 'Our conversations with the children point to them both being remorseful for the pain and anguish they have caused their families and the local community. 'Every parent will recognise that children, in their teenage years, can be na\u00efve and they will make mistakes. 'Brent Council is fully focused on working with the families and our partners to ensure these children get the support and guidance they need.' It came as the 'devastated' families of the boys said they couldn't 'thank the police and Turkish authorities enough' for getting them home safely. Mr Butt said: 'They are just normal kids with aspirations like any other kids and their families would do anything to support them and they will continue to support them to make sure they become an engineer or a doctor. 'They are 17-years-old, they are young and naive and they are learning as they go through life. One of the two 17-year-old boys is believed to have attended Preston Manor School in Wembley, north west London (pictured). One pupil told today how he believes at least one of the boys was radicalised by a pupil . The three British teenagers who were stopped in Turkey were allegedly on their way to Syria to join ISIS. Istanbul has become a well-known stop off point for British jihadis wanting to flee to join terrorist in Syria . 'The families are overjoyed to have their children back. You have to bear in mind they're still schoolchildren, still studying for their A-levels, and the families were absolutely devastated to find that the children had disappeared and then to find that they were on their way to Istanbul - the family are still in shock. 'The families are just normal, decent, hard-working families - just a normal next door family. You would have thought no different of them on Friday than you would do today, I am sure.' He said the boys now want to get back to normal, adding: 'They just want to go back to school and continue their studies. 'They made a mistake and they just want to get back to normal, so that's what we're going to do as a council help them get back on track.' Mr Butt said the families contacted the police on Friday morning as soon as they realised their boys were missing. The three teenagers were stopped in Istanbul in a dramatic security operation after British police tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul and the trio were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sources in Turkey said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities but none of them are believed to be connected to any high-profile ISIS terrorists. The two 17-year-old boys, along with a 19-year-old man, all from north-west London, were detained in Istanbul, Turkey, the Met Police said. They are believed to have been travelling to join ISIS (file picture) A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators now hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. More than 600 Britons have fled Britain for Syria and Iraq since the appalling explosion of violence in the region began. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'. ISIS controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place.

Blackstone was deep in debt and filed for bankruptcy just three years ago, court papers uncovered by Daily Mail Online reveal. And Jill owed Wendy Blackstone, the deaf and blind sister who died of asphyxiation on March 14, more than $122,000 for a loan, the papers reveal. Blackstone was recently forced to sell the three-bedroom, two-bath house that she and her sister had called home for eight years, although they continued to live in it as the new owners awaited permission to demolish and rebuild. Motive? Money troubles may have been the bottom of what police and friends believe was a shocking suicide pact that saw Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone (left) survive after the death of her disabled sister, Wendy (right) 'She couldn't get the money she wanted,' one neighbor told Daily Mail Online exclusively. 'So she listed the house for less \u2014 under a million \u2014 and when it sold, I imagine that's when she became desperate.' Public records reveal that Blackstone put the single story house in Studio City, in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, on the market in November for $950,000. It sold within a month for the full asking price. She had bought the house in 2007 for $930,000. Papers filed in her 2012 bankruptcy reveal she was paying $5,055 a month in mortgage payments \u2014 more than 60% of her total income. Shimon Ben, an agent for the new owners, refused to talk to Daily Mail Online about whether the sale of the house was connected to the apparent suicide pact. 'Don't ask me questions, do me a favor,' Ben said before hanging up the phone. Blackstone, 52, was arrested after her sister was found dead in the garage of the Landale Street house. Police told TMZ they\u00a0believe Jill intended to kill herself along with Wendy and their three dogs. Paramedics arrived at the scene to find Wendy and the dogs dead. They were killed by carbon monoxide fumes coming from a barbecue grill placed at Wendy's feet. Attempts to resuscitate Wendy, 49, who was grasping a handwritten suicide note believed to have been written by her sister, failed. But Jill apparently woke up and had a change of heart about killing herself. She called a friend who then dialed 911. Jill Blackstone was hospitalized for two days with carbon monoxide poisoning. After treatment she was charged with first-degree murder and held on $1 million bail, but she was released from custody on Wednesday of last week and the charges were dropped. Do not disturb:\u00a0Public records reveal that Blackstone put the single story house in Studio City, in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, on the market in November for $950,000. It sold within a month for the full asking price. She had bought the house in 2007 for $930,000 but she has yet to move out . Police told Daily Mail Online the investigation into Wendy's death is still ongoing and would not comment on whether her money woes were part of the probe. Jill was spotted returning in tears to the home where her sister died on Thursday. The neighbor says she and others on the small cul de sac where many homes are being demolished and rebuilt are angry at what they believe to be Blackstone's actions. 'That was not the answer to her problems,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'She was trying to find a foundation that would help them and help financially take care of her sister, but I don't think she got very far. 'No-one had to die over money. There had to be other options.' The neighbor said the two women always looked depressed. 'You could see it in them whenever they were outside in the yard or walking the dogs. These were not happy women.' Papers entered in court in support of her bankruptcy showed Jill Blackstone was $1.4 million in debt when she filed in August 2012. Her total assets were listed at only half that figure. She claimed she was disputing a $300,000 debt owed to Mad Men hair stylist Lucia Mace and her husband from a 2010 injury claim. However, when Daily Mail Online contacted the three-time-Emmy winner, Mace said: 'I have no idea what you are talking about,' claiming she had never heard of Blackstone. She then hung up. They sisters continued to live in the home as new owners awaited permission to demolish and rebuild . The papers showed Jill Blackstone owed Wendy $122,126.33 for a 2010 loan. She also owed another relative $4,000. Her bankruptcy papers show that Blackstone was drowning in debt, constantly spending more each month than she was bringing in. She said she earned $7,431 a month after tax with a further $826 coming from her disabled sister's social security. Blackstone, who had produced episodes of the Sally Jessy Raphael Show and the Rosie O'Donnell Show as well as The Jerry Springer Show, listed total monthly expenses at $8,967 \u2014 $709 more than she earned. She said her cash in hand at the time came to just $40, with her two bank accounts containing a mere $904.31. And her debts, many from store credit cards, were mounting. She owed $520 on her Banana Republic card; $798 on her Barneys New York card; $103 on her Bloomingdale's card and $172 on her Gap card. But those debts were tiny compared to bank credit cards. She owed more than $27,000 on her Chase MasterCard, the court papers reveal, a further $3,850 on her CitiCard MasterCard, $1,800 on her Credit One MasterCard; $7,400 to GE Care Credit, and nearly $4,000 on two PayPal accounts. Medical bills too were piling up as she detailed more than $2,800 owed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a further $13,000 to UCLA Medical Center, $4.300 to a New York orthopedic surgeon, $2,000 to a dentist and $400 to endodontist \u00a0along with a further $560 owed to the Jules Stein Eye Institute. Other debts included nearly $5,500 to her accountants, $12,000 for a loan on her 2010 Toyota Prius and more than $1,000 to her lawyer. Jill and Wendy \u00a0ran the non-profit Thumping Tails animal rescue from their home. But three dogs were found dead in the garage along with Wendy . The two sisters ran the non-profit Thumping Tails animal rescue, which they operated from their home \u2014 and that too was proving costly, Blackstone's bankruptcy papers reveal. She owed more than $4,800 to the Northridge Animal Hospital and a further $4,300 to the Veterinary Medical Center in Studio City. The neighbor said the fact that Blackstone rescued pets and found them good homes made the decision to take her dogs' lives along with her sister's even more unexplainable. Through tears, the neighbor said: 'The dogs didn't have to die. 'That was the most selfish, evil things she could have done. Her neighbors are just furious. I'm so angry I'm spitting bullets. 'She loved her dogs desperately. They were her world. So why would she do that? It breaks my heart, it really does. It sickens me.'

However, during parliament on Tuesday the chief minister Adam Giles accused the media of not reporting the story because the child was not 'a blonde-haired, blue eyed little girl.'

He said police took great care in making sure that when action was taken it was correct and would not prejudice any case before the courts. He would not comment on the chief minister using such a sensitive issue as a 'political football'. Earlier Mr Giles announced the alleged rape had sparked crisis talks on town camps. All government agencies involved in delivering services and law enforcement at town camps across Alice Springs and Tennant Creek will meet at a closed forum on Friday to discuss safety and living conditions and the performance of government and private organisations providing services.

It was the least they deserved after the home team had dominated most of the game as the MLS\u2019s two newest sides went toe-to-toe in this showpiece event. The city had been celebrating their new team all weekend ahead of the match; a festival atmosphere enveloping the place the day before and starting again with barbecues outside the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium well before the game. Football is a team game, but this was very much about one man: Kaka. Two teams were making their MLS debuts in front of a sold out 63,000-strong crowd, but the Brazilian, considered the greatest player on the planet in 2007, was playing the lead role. He did not let down his adoring fans. His mere presence on the pitch whipped the striking purple crowd into a frenzy, from the moment he led the side out ahead of kick off for the very first time, introducing city to their new team. It took only two minutes for him to make his mark. Just placing a ball for a free kick drew pandemonium around the Citrus Bowl, but he delivered a ball into the box which Seb Hines, on loan from Middlesbrough, headed inches wide of the left post. The home side dominated, and Kaka was the catalyst for everything. He nudged the ball with his thigh, 12 minutes in, travelling outside the area with its momentum and hitting a left-foot shot just wide.

In the best chance of the half passes exchanged between Kaka, Lewis Neal and Kevin Molino and ended with the ball laying off for the main man to shoot first time, his powerful effort saved. His $7,167,500 salary is mammoth, but so is the responsibility on his shoulders to carry the team. He showed yet another example of what he will bring for that in the 23rd minute, picking the ball up 10 yards outside the area and turning quickly to change the direction of play to pass to Brek Shea free on the left, who shot narrowly over. Two minutes later, the crowd were raising from their seats, straining to get a better look, as he drove forward with the ball on the left, tried to get in between two defenders then eventually got a shot away. When Shea, formerly of Stoke, Barnsley and Birmingham, produced a 360 spin to beat an opponent, there was clearly a touch of Samba to his thinking. This was not to forget that former Barcelona forward David Villa, another of the league\u2019s newest stars, was making his debut for New York City where he will be teaming up with Frank Lampard when the Manchester City midfielder joins in the summer.

It has been dated to the early 1st century by a British archaeologist who says an ancient text points to the building as being the home in Nazareth where Mary and Joseph brought up the son of God. Professor Ken Dark says De Locis Sanctis, written in 670 by Irish monk Adomnan, described the house as located between two tombs and below a church. A British archaeologist has identified what he believes could have been the house (exterior pictured) where Jesus was raised. Dr Ken Dark said that the humble first century home in Nazareth, Northern Israel, could have been where Mary and Joseph brought up the son of God . In the first century, two tombs were built beside what is believed to be Jesus' home. The forecourt of the tomb seen here passes through the abandoned home. Dr Ken Dark describes it as having been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway . The text was based on a pilgrimage to Nazareth made by the Frankish bishop Arculf and tells of a church \u2018where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy\u2019. In the Byzantine era, and again in the 12th century at the time of the Crusades, the ruins of the building were incorporated into churches \u2013 suggesting it was of great significance and needed to be protected, the Reading University archaeologist argues. The house was cut into a limestone hillside and has a series of rooms and a stairway. One of the original doorways has survived, as has part of the original chalk floor. The key piece of evidence linking the site to Jesus is pilgrim text called 'De Locus Sanctis' written in 670 AD by abbot Adomn\u00e0n of Iona (pictured) It was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to Nazareth and talks about a church 'where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy' The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, Dr Dark writes.The house he believes was Jesus' boyhood home stands in between the two tombs which also matches with Adomn\u00e0n's account . Writing in the journal Biblical Archaeological Review, Dr Dark says that while he has no proof, there is \u2018no good reason\u2019 to believe it was not Jesus\u2019s home. He has been researching the ruins, in what is now northern Israel, since 2006. The house was first identified as significant in the 1880s after the chance discovery of by nuns an ancient cistern. An excavation was ordered. Jesuit priest Henri Senes carried out more work in 1936. Since 2006, Dr Dark\u2019s team has discovered broken cooking pots, a spindle whorl and limestone artefacts. The limestone items suggest a Jewish family lived there as Jews believed that limestone could not be impure \u2013 and Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth when the angel Gabriel revealed that Mary would give birth to the son of God, a baby to be named Jesus. The house is thought to be located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. The key piece of evidence linking the site to Jesus is pilgrim text called 'De Locus Sanctis' written in 670 AD by abbot Adomn\u00e0n of Iona. It was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to Nazareth made by the Frankish bishop Arculf and talks about a church 'where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy.' He writes: 'The other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs. 'Between these two tombs was the house in which Jesus was raised. From this is derived the more recent name for the church that Adomn\u00e0n described'. The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, Dr Dark writes. The house is thought to be located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth . The last attempt to identify the house where Jesus grew up was in 2009 when archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority found another 1st century home they believed had been occupied by a Jewish family. Pictured an Israeli Antiquities Authority worker clears debris during the 2009 excavation . Dr Dark, a specialist in first century and Christian archaeology, argues that the house he believes was Jesus\u2019s boyhood home matches Adomnan\u2019s account. It is located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent, which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. Artefacts at the site included broken cooking pots, a spindle whorl and limestone artifacts. The limestone items suggest a Jewish family lived there as Jews believed that limestone could not be impure. The house has been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway.\u00a0One of the original doorways has survived\u00a0as has part of the original chalk floor. The house is located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. Subsequent generations after the first century took great care to look after the site.\u00a0The house was decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine period, suggesting that they were of special importance. The Adomnan text describes two churches in Nazareth, one of which was the Church of Annunciation. Dr Dark writes: \u2018The other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs.\u2019 The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, he says. Dr Dark writes: \u2018Great efforts had been made to encompass the remains of this building. Both the tombs and the house were decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine period, suggesting that they were of special importance, and possibly venerated. \u2018Was this the house where Jesus grew up? It is impossible to say on archaeological grounds. 'On the other hand, there is no good archaeological reason why such an identification should be discounted.\u2019 In 2009 archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority found another 1st century home nearby they believed had been occupied by a Jewish family. However they were able to say only that Jesus may have lived near the site. Along with the home, a number of water sources have also been found at Nazareth. They would have been accessed with Jesus was alive.

Within minutes of arriving at Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, on Friday, several pupils had been sent back home for wearing 'incorrect' footwear. The secondary school, which has 860 pupils, states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned. Almost a dozen pupils were sent home from Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, for wearing 'incorrect' footwear to school after a crackdown on uniform policy . Parents have blasted the school after most of the students were wearing plain black laced Kicker shoes . It decided to revisit its policy as part of a drive to improve standards at the previously failing school and a letter was sent out reminding parents what it considered to be 'correct' footwear, last week. But parents have blasted the academy, saying their children's shoes were plain black and from the range marketed for school wear. The letter, issued on Wednesday, read: 'Students should be wearing black shoes that can be polished. Any other colours of shoes, trainers or boots of any description are not permitted.' Maddie Hayes, 14, was among a number of students excluded on Friday, despite having worn the same brand of plain black shoe for the last three years. Her mother, Jackie Hayes, 37, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, said: 'I received a call from Maddie's school to say she was being excluded for the day for not wearing the right shoes. Jackie Hayes, left, with her daughter Maddie, 14, right, who was sent home from school on Friday . 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing because she has only ever worn plain black Kickers shoes which are sold as a popular school shoe. Miss Hayes, a travel agent from Coulby Newham, said her daughter was one of more than 20 pupils either sent home or put in isolation for wearing the wrong school attire. 'When I got to the school Maddie said she was at first given a detention and was given a pair of shoes by the school to put on. But when she refused she was told she was excluded. 'Attendance at the school is already a major issue yet they are sending kids home. Fair enough if the shoes were brightly coloured or had high heels, but Maddie's are plain, basic, black shoes.' But executive principal, Rob Tarn, said some of the shoes were boots, which is against the school's rules. He said:\u00a0'Nothing has changed here, we have always been clear regarding our requirements with uniform and our Acklam academy has high expectations of student behaviour. 'This includes our clear guidance on footwear which has been shared with parents on a number of occasions. 'Students whose footwear does not meet the requirements are asked if they wish to borrow a pair of shoes bought by the academy until they can purchase a more appropriate pair for themselves, a request which we deem to be reasonable. 'Part of the reason that examination results are rising so rapidly is that staff can focus on conversations about learning rather than have repeated conversations about compliance with uniform which is tremendously distracting. 'I would ask that parents give us their full support in our attempts to deliver an outstanding education for their children.' A spokesperson for Outwood Grange Academies Trust which oversees the school, said: 'The trust has established a clear uniform policy which has been shared extensively with students and their families at the academy. 'The trust purchased uniform for all students when it opened in 2013 and has an ongoing commitment to purchase uniform for all students joining in Year 7. The secondary school's rules states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned . Several pupils were sent home after refusing to wear another pair of shoes provided for them by the school and other were put in isolation or given a detention . 'The trust provides all items of uniform including sports kit and socks, the only item of uniform not provided by the trust is shoes. 'The current issue has arisen as a result of only 11 students who are refusing to wear footwear in line with the academy's uniform policy. 'The uniform policy clearly states that students must wear shoes that are plain black (this means students cannot wear boots or shoes with logos). 'The academy has offered to provide alternative footwear for the small number of students concerned and this offer has been declined. 'The trust can confirm that it does not exclude students for wearing incorrect uniform, however, if a student refuses to follow a reasonable request to change their footwear, then this would lead to a fixed term exclusion.' Olivia Adams said a teacher cut off the tags to her Kickers shoes while she was still wearing them . Kickers shoes have been at the centre of a uniform row in the past. In November 2013 a teacher at North School in Ashford, Kent, allegedly cut labels off a schoolgirl's shoes. Olivia Adams, 13, was told the green and red tags broke an 'all-black' uniform rule and her teacher apparently cut them off while she they were still on her feet. Her mother Claire Pamment immediately complained to head teacher Lesley Ellis - who apologised and offered her \u00a355 to buy a new pair. But Ms Pammett took the row to police, insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault. The school failed to comment at the time, but police said it was investigating a complaint of criminal damage. In another bizarre incident, teachers at BBG Academy in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, became so fed up with students wearing 'inappropriate footwear' that it took them on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store. Pupils were taken to a branch of Wynsors World of Shoes on separate occasions over two weeks in December last year after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes. Teachers paid \u00a318 for each pair, which about 40 parents were then expected to pay at a later stage. Meanwhile, dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the 'wrong' shoes. Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear in September last year. Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff, insists that letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable. In November last year, Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, sent home 152 pupils in one day after they failed to meet new strict uniform policy. Nearly 10 per cent of pupils failed to meet standards on the first day the rules were introduced and the next day 63 pupils were sent home - taking the total number to 215 in two days. The BBG Academy (pictured) in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, ferried up to 75 students who were breaching uniform rules to Wynsor's World of Shoes . Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard. A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers. Headteacher Elizabeth Churton, who has been at the school for two years, said the rules were not new and staff were simply 'reinforcing the rules that are in place.' The Coseley School in Bilston, West Midlands, also sent home around 100 students after arriving at school for the first day of term because their footwear was not 'black leather'. Emma Guthrie, who bought a \u00a320 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good. 'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing? 'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' In 2011 Cardinal Newham Catholic School in Keresley, Coventry, banned 17 pupils from an important mathematics GCSE exam for wearing the wrong shoes. Students, aged between 15 and 16, were given their marching orders 20 minutes before they were due to start the test after refusing to change their footwear or take the exam in their socks. Patrick Doherty, 15, was due to sit the exam again after he failed it last summer having taken it a year early. He refused to take his shoes off because of fears his feet would smell and now faces a year at home before he can re-sit the exam again.", "label": 0.4166666716337204, "predicted": 0.6852445006370544}, "155": {"text": "Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal believes the outcome of the FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal will not just affect the destiny of the venerable old trophy but also the contest for Champions League positions.

It is very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the [Premier League] rat race.' Van Gaal also paid tribute to the longevity of Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996. He added: 'In my opinion what he has done is amazing. It can only be in England, I believe, where managers are so long committed with one club. 'It shows how much he can mean for a club as a manager.

That, however, transpired to the least of his worries. Soon after, he was embroiled in what we can politely describe as a lively exchange about the nature of his relationship with his assistant Ryan Giggs. Pictures of a rather underwhelmed Giggs at St James' Park on Wednesday and some quotes from his old friend Paul Scholes had given weight earlier in the day to some recent chatter about the United icon's thoughts on Van Gaal's style of play and indeed his own future. Louis van Gaal was not best pleased after his relationship with Ryan Giggs was questioned . Giggs did not respond to Van Gaal's in-your-face celebrations after United's late win against Newcastle . The Manchester United boss gave a tetchy press conference ahead of Monday's FA Cup clash with Arsenal . And then there was the Jonny Evans issue. Caught on film spitting towards the ground during a clash with Newcastle centre forward Papiss Cisse, the United central defender now stands accused \u2013 rightly or wrongly - of one of the most frowned upon acts in sport. All in all, it was another challenging day at the office for United's manager. No wonder his mood was rather spiky. 'No, we have a very bad relationship,' said Van Gaal of Giggs, rather sarcastically. 'I'm very irritated because of this question. 'Everyone can see we have a very good relationship and work very hard together, not only Ryan Giggs but all the staff and players. 'This [your question] is a way of suggesting things. 'So now I am very irritated and I take my message against the media. I'm not pleased. 'I think 90 per cent [of everything you say] is not happening.'

The former Holland manager laughs from the dugout at St James' Park while his No 2 remains stony faced . Giggs (2nd left) did not appear to join in his manager's celebrations after United's late victory at Newcastle . Images of Giggs failing to join Van Gaal's celebrations after Ashley Young's 89th minute goal at St James Park on Wednesday were certainly peculiar. So, too, were quotes from Scholes on TV before kick-off. 'There's no doubt, he had that little taste of it for the last three weeks of last year and he definitely wants to be a manager,' Scholes told BT Sport. 'You can see that. Over the next two or three years, will he have the patience to be a No 2 for that long? I'm not sure he will.' Giggs is reportedly angry after former team-mate Paul Scholes (right) questioned his contentment at United . Giggs is understood to have been non-plussed by David Moyes' style of play at Manchester United . The United icon took charge at Old Trafford for the final games of last season following Moyes' sacking . Giggs and Scholes worked together at United when the former was handed the reins last season in the wake of David Moyes' sacking. Former team-mates, they know each other very well. Nevertheless, it is understood that Giggs views his friend's comments as unhelpful and is furious that anyone should voice doubts about his relationship with Van Gaal. It is not hard to wonder, though, what Giggs does make of the Dutch coach's style. Giggs grew frustrated at Moyes' reluctance to play on the front foot last season and immediately sought to change it during his spell as interim manager last April and May. Giggs instinctively went back to what he emotively called 'the United way'. So have things improved that much this season? It is hard to say that they have. For now, though, United fans will listen to Van Gaal's words and learn of Giggs' irritation and perhaps be soothed. If performances pick up - starting with a home FA Cup tie with Arsenal on Monday - then the subject will be allowed to melt away. United defender Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse have been charged with spitting during the game . \u2018Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night\u2019s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. \u2018I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. \u2018It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.\u2019 THE GAMES HE COULD MISS FOR UNITED: Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Man City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. Evans and Cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on Wednesday night . \u2018I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. \u2018I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. \u2018I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.\u2019 THE GAMES HE\u2019LL MISS FOR NEWCASTLE: Everton (a), March 15; Arsenal (h), March 21; Sunderland (a), April 5; Liverpool (a), April 13; Tottenham (h), April 19; Swansea (h), April 25; Leicester (a), May 2. Cisse has accepted a possible seven-game ban while Evans has until 6pm on Friday February 6 to respond . As for Evans, he will clearly tell the FA that he didn't mean to spit at Cisse on Wednesday but may still be fortunate to escape a ban of six games. Footage would appear to be inconclusive and it is easy to sympathise with the Irishman's claim in a statement on Thursday that he was not spitting at his opponent. His manager clearly believes him, too, but whether the FA will feel they can prove the case against one player - Cisse - and not the other will perhaps worry Van Gaal as he contemplates playing much of the remainder of the season without his centre half. 'Of course I've spoken with Jonny Evans,' said the United manager. 'It is like what I said in the press conference after match that he was not aware he was spitting. 'And when he was spitting on the ground, maybe it's a natural thing from a human being. 'I think it was not his intention and that I said already. 'I cannot imagine that Jonny Evans could do that. 'And he has said this also so I believe him. 'So for me the matter has done.' United will renew their rivalry with Arsenal when Van Gaal takes on Arsene Wenger in the FA Cup quarter-final . With Monday's game at Old Trafford so important to United in terms of their chances of not only winning a trophy but also of finding the required confidence to take in to some tough Barclays Premier League fixtures, Van Gaal may have hoped for a rather less eventful build-up. Amid it all, at least he can cling to results. United remain fourth in the Premier League and, somehow, on course for the Champions League qualification that was stated as a pre-requisite at the start of the season. Criticism has been a constant companion throughout his time in England and, indeed, during previous spells in Holland and Spain. It is partly because of this that it was surprising to see him so irked. He is usually a little more phlegmatic. One imagines that passage to the last four of the FA Cup on Monday night would put much of it right.", "label": 0.18055555829778314, "predicted": 0.39051705598831177}, "158": {"text": "A bankrupt solicitor who owes more than \u00a352million to a bank was \u2018barricaded in\u2019 at his mansion, a court heard.

And members of anti-repossession group, the Land League, congregated at the O\u2019Donnells\u2019 south Dublin fortress. But now O'Donnell has been accused of trespassing on the property as he refused to leave the mansion. It came after a trespass notice was nailed to the front gate of the mansion by representatives of the receivers and O'Donnell was asked to leave the house immediately. But in a fresh case by O'Donnell's children, they claim the bank \u2018fraudulently\u2019 secured the \u20ac70million (\u00a352million) judgment against their parents and therefore the house cannot be seized on foot of that court order, made in December 2011.

He described the notion of any conspiracy by the bank and its advisers against the family as \u2018deluded\u2019. The court heard that the four offspring had in fact surrendered their rights over their home yesterday morning \u2013 but that their father was now occupying the property. Representatives thought to be from the receiver's office nail a trespass notice to the front gate of O'Donnell's home in Dublin . The notice means that Mr O'Donnell now stands accused of trespassing after refusing to leave the property immediately under orders by the court . Rossa Fanning, for the receiver, told the court: \u2018The property has been barricaded in this afternoon.\u2019 The court heard that in a written statement, Brian O\u2019Donnell had threatened to call garda\u00ed (police) if the bank\u2019s receiver \u2018should harass us\u2019. His statement, read to the court by Mr Ferriter, said: \u2018My wife and I have a right of residence in Gorse Hill... Should Tom Kavanagh harass us at the property on March 2, we will call the police.\u2019 Mr Ferriter told the court he understood that protesters from the Land League organisation had \u2018erected some sort of barricade at the property\u2019. He added: \u2018We understand a member of the family is in the house, Brian O\u2019Donnell. \u2018This is the type of behaviour orchestrated by the O\u2019Donnell family is in the face of what the Supreme Court determined. We are most troubled by that.\u2019 John Martin from the Land League pictured at the front door to Gorse Hill, where Mr O'Donnell has barricaded himself in . Mr Ferriter pointed out that the couple had previously stated they were permanent residents of London, but were \u2018now moving back in\u2019 to the Dublin home. Blake O\u2019Donnell, 31, told the court the bank was \u2018attempting to remove us from the property and seize it\u2019. He said Bank of Ireland had \u2018run our family into the courts to try and get judgments and seize our assets from us.\u2019 Blake added his parents \u2018are in occupation of the property at the moment\u2019 and they have a \u2018right of residence\u2019.

Meanwhile, at the gates of Brian O\u2019Donnell\u2019s lavish Vico Road home last night, the situation escalated after an intense stand-off between the receivers and campaigners. Shortly after 6.15pm, a blacked-out eight-seater van pulled up outside Gorse Hill. Speaking through a small crack in the thick wooden gates and high walls, Tom Kavanagh, a receiver from Kavanagh Fennell, asked Land League campaigners who they were. Mr Kavanagh asked the campaigners who owned the red car that blocked the front gate outside Mr O\u2019Donnell\u2019s property. The receiver was told sharply by one campaigner that the car belonged to the \u2018car\u2019s owners\u2019. The campaigner said he was not prepared to give his name or the names of his associates. But Jerry Beades of the Land League told the Mail yesterday: \u2018We are just helping the [O\u2019Donnell] family as we do any family facing eviction.\u2019 After several minutes, Mr Kavanagh and three other people left the front gate. The campaigners said it \u2018seems likely\u2019 they will stay for the night behind the heavy gates, however, they refused to identify themselves or how many were there when asked by the Mail. A red car has been parked at the gates to Gorse Hill to block the property, where anti-eviction campaigners are camped outside . As the snow began to fall and temperatures plummeted, the campaigners made their way out on to the quiet south Dublin road. One campaigner said they were going to get food before settling in for the night as he told others behind the wall that they would change shifts every four or five hours. The O\u2019Donnell couple built up a global property empire worth close to \u20ac1billion (\u00a3732million) and at the height of the boom, it seemed the world was theirs for the taking.

Yet incredibly this Melbourne-based couple, both aged 30, have never consummated their marriage - and Erica admits that she has no intention of ever doing so. For while Andrew would love to rip his wife's clothes off, Erica  is in fact still a virgin and reveals to the Daily Mail Online that the very idea of making love to her husband is a complete turn off rather than a turn on. Unique arrangement: Erica and Andrew Holloway have been married since October 2012 but have never had sex because Erica is 'repulsed' by the idea . 'I wish I wanted to have sex with my husband,' Erica, a graphic designer, explains. 'But I don't and I know I never will as, while I love him, the idea of sex repulses me. 'We are still very affectionate with each other and love to hold hands and kiss and cuddle, but that's as far as I could ever go. 'People might think our marriage would be a disaster because of this, but we are as happy now as the day we met.' Erica has known since the tender age of 15 that she was asexual - after realizing that she had never felt sexually attracted to anyone. And despite trying to force herself to feel some kind of sexual desire towards a few men in her late teens, she admits that she failed to ever feel the kind of connection that so many of her peers seemed to experience . At this point, Erica had almost given up on ever finding love, as, perhaps unsurprisingly, most men she met ran a mile when she told them about her total aversion to sex. 'It was such a frustrating period of my life as I knew I was different, I just didn't know why,' she recalls. 'All my friends were experimenting with boyfriends, yet when I even kissed a boy, it just left me cold. 'I still wanted the companionship you get from a partner, I just didn't want the sex side and I worried I would never ever find anyone who would be prepared to love and accept me the way I am.' But in 2002, Erica's world changed when she met Andrew, while the pair were both living in Melbourne. She admits that she felt as though she had finally met a man who did love her just the way she was. And after first living as housemates, the pair became an official couple in 2009 after Andrew moved to Canada and the duo realized that they couldn't bear to be apart from one another. They were married on October 27th 2012. Happy couple: Erica, pictured with Andrew on their wedding day in 2012, allows her husband to sleep with other women, including professional escorts . True love: Erica and Andrew became a couple in 2009, after seven years of friendship blossomed into something more . 'I was very honest with Andrew and didn't think for a moment we would ever be anything more than friends, ' Erica says. 'But when he emigrated to Canada in 2008, I think we both realized how much we missed each other and have never looked back since. 'We just connect on every level, apart from sexually, and are each others soul mates. Neither of us has ever wanted a family, so that helps too. 'We are the perfect couple, we just don't have sex.' Yet Andrew admits it was not easy to come to terms with sharing his life with a woman who had no desire to share his bed and he even had second thoughts about asking her to be his wife. 'I loved Erica from the moment I met her and back then naively thought I would one day convince her to fancy me,' the IT manager explains. 'But over time while our love has grown, Erica's aversion to sex has not once waivered and it has not been easy for me to deal with. 'She is the one woman I dream of having sex with, yet I know I never will and that has been sad. 'And there was a period when I did question whether if I asked her to marry me it could ever work. 'But every time I thought about ending it, I knew I could not live without her in my life. 'If I didn't love her as much as I do it would never have lasted, but we are still hopelessly in love in spite of our lack of intimacy. 'On our wedding night I longed to make love to her, but I couldn't and that did cause us both pain. 'But over time we have made this situation work as I would rather share my life with Erica with no sex than not at all.' The couple reveal that, in order to make their relationship work, they now have an open marriage, whereby Erica not only turns a blind eye to Andrew having sex with other women, she has also been the driving force behind his flings. And to date he has slept with ten other women. Making it work: Erica insists that she and Andrew have the 'perfect relationship', despite not being sexually intimate with one another . Wedded bliss: The couple, pictured on their wedding day, were determined to make their marriage work, despite Andrew admitting that he found Erica's issues with sex difficult to deal with . 'Just because I don't want sex, I understand Andrew does, so we sought help from a sex counselor who came up with the suggestion he takes lovers and it seemed the perfect solution for us,' Erica says. 'Jealousy is never a factor as I'm just relieved Andrew is having sex; I feel guilty it can't be with me. 'It's not that often, but when he feels the desire, he either calls an escort or maybe a woman who he has met on the Internet and goes to see them. 'I just wave him off and tell him to have a good time and I absolutely mean it. 'We never discuss what he has got up to, but I know by the huge smile on his face when he comes through the door he has had a good time and that makes me happy.' It is an unconventional marital set up that Andrew admits has been harder for him to get used to than Erica. 'When I got married I never once thought I would be cheating on my wife and I still struggle with it as it just seems like a betrayal of our vows,' he explains. 'But over time it is getting easier and it does take the pressure off Erica. 'Of course I would rather be having sex with her, but if I can't then this seems like the best solution as it is the only thing missing in my life and marriage.' Indeed, so comfortable is Erica with Andrew having sex with other women, the she admits she is even trying to find her husband a permanent live-in lover. She explained: 'I think that would be the dream situation, as that way Andrew doesn't even need to leave our home to have sex. 'But finding someone we both like enough to share our home with is no easy task and to date we have been unsuccessful. 'Our dream scenario is to find someone we both really enjoy the company of who would live in our spare room and be an integral part of our family who can also enjoy an intimate relationship with Andrew.' Andrew added: 'We know we don't have a conventional marriage, but Erica and I are 100 per cent happy and it works for us. 'We just feel lucky to have even found each other so if the only thing missing is sex, then I still think we have more than what most people will ever have in their marriage.'", "label": 0.39772728458046913, "predicted": 0.4681832194328308}, "160": {"text": "More beheaded animals have been found near the Northern California city of Sacramento, the latest in a string of mutilations since the beginning of the year. A birdwatcher working the fields of Yolo County on Sunday found a collection of five beheaded chickens and a beheaded turtle. Gina Knepp, who runs Sacramento's Front Street Animal Shelter, says it's the second find that included a turtle. Beheadings continue: A birdwatcher in Sacramento found five beheaded chickens and a turtle in a shopping bag dumped in a field. The find comes just wees after an animal control officer discovered chicken carcasses in a bag (pictured) She suspects the remains might be related to Santeria or other religious rituals that include animal sacrifices. \u2018The turtle is a sign of Santeria, based on the little I know,\u2019 Knepp told The Sacramento Bee. More common in Florida than California, Santeria is an Afro-Cuban religion that includes animal sacrifice. Chickens, goats and other animals are used in its rituals. The newspaper reports there have been at least 13 separate discoveries of decapitated goats, sheep and chickens and other animals since January. A county animal control officer went to the area of Babel Slough and South River roads shortly after the birdwatcher at 2pm called in a report of animal carcasses, a sheriff\u2019s sergeant said. The Sunday discovery was the first reported since a Sacramento Bee reporter March 4 found a bag of decapitated chickens along the railroad tracks at 20th and W streets in Sacramento. The birdwatcher who made the disturbing discovery Sunday said the animal carcasses looked 'very fresh' and the blood appeared 'very red.' Earlier this month,\u00a0two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River . The remains of the decapitated chickens and turtle were stuffed inside a brown supermarket shopping bag, which also featured simplistic yet ominous drawings. 'It looked to me like stick drawings of a head and a neck with a line drawn through it,' she said. Earlier this month, authorities reported finding two bags containing dead animals beside railroad tracks in Midtown Sacramento. One bag contained a beheaded rabbit with several tea candles. A second bag held at least two decapitated chickens with their feet cut off . Two weeks ago, two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River.

But despite sporadic positive feedback from the Khan camp, who told Hearn at a recent meeting in Blackpool that the bout 'will happen one day', the trail has since gone cold. Brook, who defends his title on March 28 against Jo Jo Dan, said: 'I think he is avoiding me like the plague. He said that I'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him? 'After I'm done with Amir Khan he will just be a mere memory. 'He wants to fight some of these kids who have been super-featherweights. I am a genuine big welterweight who can seek and destroy him.' Hearn added: 'We want the fight so badly. We don't believe we should take anything less than 50-50 but until we talk maybe we do. Kell has not been in a mega-fight and has masses of monster paydays in front of him. If he has to give Amir a little something to knock him out he probably will.' Khan's fight in Sheffield on March 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in Tenerife last September that could have cost his life. At the very least it has meant a major delay in Brook defending his world title for the first time. He intends on three more fights this year, though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao than he does of landing a Khan bout that would draw enormous domestic interest.

A Khan fight is so easy to make. All the signs are there for it to be an unbelievable fight. 'I have seen clips of him saying, 'Win a world title', 'Do this, do that'. I have come through everything he has said and still nothing. 'I think people around him are blowing smoke up his **** and he is believing all the hype.

Van Dijk will face United at Hampden after his red card was quashed \u2013 with Calum Butcher, the man the Dutch defender tangled with on the Tannadice turf \u2013 already cleared to play due to being the beneficiary of mistaken identity by linesman Graham Chambers. But while the United boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of Nadir Ciftci - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions, he believes Celtic\u2019s readiness to question the loophole that got Butcher off the hook was inappropriate. Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the first half of the Scottish Cup draw with Dundee United . \u2018If you ask me, I would prefer that all the guys were playing \u2013 Nadir as well even though he picked up two yellows,\u2019 McNamara said. \u2018You want all of your best players to be playing in Cup Finals - you don\u2019t want anyone to miss out. \u2018I can understand the decisions. The two of them \u2013 Butcher and van Dijk were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules, whether it\u2019s right or wrong, that\u2019s just the way it is. \u2018I don\u2019t think the whole thing is right. But again, it\u2019s outwith my control. The Celtic defender went in hard on opposing player Callum Butcher at Tannadice . \u2018From our point of view, we have kept our silence and our focus on Sunday. \u2018We haven\u2019t mentioned anything about wanting anyone suspended or that this guy has done this or that. \u2018We\u2019re focused on our own team. The last thing I would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what-not when it\u2019s been dealt with by the authorities. I\u2019m pleased that they haven\u2019t.\u2019 The fall-out from the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Tannadice has threatened to overshadow the build-up to the first showpiece occasion of the season. McNamara, for one, feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1-1 draw on Tayside last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence. \u2018I don\u2019t think it would be a bad thing in certain instances. There\u2019s got to be a real call for it,\u2019 he added. \u2018On Sunday, with the time it took them to make a decision, I think it would have been helpful. \u2018But again, it\u2019s affordability. Where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and aren\u2019t on television? \u2018The game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals. Video evidence \u2026 it seems to be going that way.\u2019 Dundee United players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the Scottish Cup . Dundee United lost the Scottish Cup final to St Johnstone at the end of McNamara\u2019s first season in charge. Rank outsiders to upset Ronny Deila\u2019s Treble-seeking side this weekend, the former Celtic star believes it\u2019s imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the League Cup trophy. \u2018I think that\u2019s key to it,\u2019 he continued. \u2018It\u2019s Celtic again, but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign. \u2018It shouldn\u2019t come into play at all what happened last Sunday. I\u2019ll make sure that the players understand the importance of discipline. We have to be committed, we have to compete, but first and foremost we have got to make sure we keep our cool.\u2019 The second of four back-to-back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions, McNamara believes that Celtic\u2019s superior depth in squad is another factor in Deila\u2019s favour this Sunday. The Dutch defender will be able to play in the Scottish League Cup final after having his red card rescinded . \u2018You could argue that (it\u2019s easier for them) as they have the biggest squad in the league,\u2019 he added. \u2018But that\u2019s not changed from the start of the season. We just have to make sure everybody is ready. In certain games I have moved players around, I have maybe made five or six changes in a game as I need everybody ready. Not just for one game, but for a full season. Sometimes it\u2019s not worked and sometimes it has.\u2019 McNamara had revealed how he has changed his squad\u2019s routine this week, consciously making it a different experience to the build-up to last season\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Last year, the Tannadice squad were holed up in a plush St Andrews hotel for four nights whereas this week they have spent just one night there \u2013 with another overnight stay to come outside Edinburgh on Saturday. \u2018We only went for one night this year \u2013 cost cutting!\u2019 said McNamara with a smile. \u2018The media day was our day for the players so we just decided to stay up after training and just settle them down. We wanted to make sure they were all relaxed and ready for Sunday. \u2018There are certain things that we need to work on that I feel will help us if we want to win the match.\u2019 United\u00a0striker Nadir Ciftci (centre left) was also cleared for kicking Scott Brown (centre right) in the head . Asked if, with the benefit of hindsight, he regretted some aspects of last year\u2019 s preparations for the Scottish Cup final, McNamara replied: \u2018No because that\u2019s what I did at the time. \u2018I don\u2019t look at anything like that, what-ifs. I\u2019m a great believer that things happen for a reason. I\u2019m just delighted that, within a year, we find ourselves in another cup final. \u2018That says a lot about what we have at our club, what we have in the dressing room, the mentality that we\u2019re trying to instil into them. It\u2019s something that Celtic have, the belief that they can go and do it. \u2018The games that we\u2019ve struggled in this season have been when we haven\u2019t handled the expectation. Against Celtic and Aberdeen, however, we have held our own. We\u2019ve lost one, we\u2019 ve won one with both teams. In other games, where we have been expected to win, we\u2019ve fallen by the wayside. \u2018That\u2019s something we are building on. We\u2019re getting closer, but we are still way apart on the consistency side of it. Last year, we won 16 league games. This year, we have won 14 already.

The men\u00a0were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of\u00a0Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill. It is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate. Puffer fish account for the majority of Japan's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out, although it is heavily regulated.

A teenager who wrote notes to police asking them to catch him has been jailed for 21 years - for the attempted murder of three women he stabbed because he was unable to lose his virginity. Ben Moynihan, who is now 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of the three charges following a week-long trial. The judge, Mr Justice Jay, said Moynihan suffered from an autism spectrum disorder and had a 'gross lack of empathy'. Sentencing Moynihan, whom he described as 'dangerous', the judge told him: 'The offences were planned and premeditated. 'The contents of your computers were as chilling as they were disturbing.' The judge issued an extended licence of five years to be served on completion of the sentence and ordered the defendant to begin his prison term in a young offenders institution. He also ordered a \u00a320 victim surcharge to be paid. The teenager, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, stabbed the three women, aged 20, 45 and 67, with a 4.5-inch kitchen knife, aiming for their hearts, as they walked alone in Portsmouth in June and July last year. To do so, he carried a steak knife on the streets of his home city up to ten times last summer before his arrest on July 13. When he was eventually caught, police body-worn footage revealed him saying: 'You was lucky, I was hunting my fourth victim.' And before carrying his crimes, he researched serial killers including Moors murderer Ian Brady, the Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen and American Jeffrey Dahmer. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Moynihan, who called himself the 'unhappy geezer', left two letters for police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that 'all women need to die' and that he liked to smell the 'flesh he had ripped out'. The letter, left on a police van, said: 'All women needs to die and hopefully next time I can gouge their eyeballs out. 'Every time I stab someone I run home and I like to smell the flesh I ripped out. Come and arrest me for God sake before I hunt for my fourth victim.' In Moynihan's first letter to police (pictured) he labelled himself 'the unhappy geezer' and claimed to roam the streets 'hungry for blood and pain' His second letter was less cryptic - he attached a photo of himself which subsequently led to his arrest . At the bottom of the letter, Moynihan included a photograph of himself. He was arrested when police officers recognised him in the street from the picture and detained him. Another letter had a symbol from the Tomb Raider game on it. It said: 'When women won't talk to you it's heartbreaking, why are they fussy with men nowadays.' It continued: 'I roam these streets, hungry for blood and pain, I be greeted with attack, attack, attack, attack, dead, jolly good!' In a video found on his laptop, Moynihan had filmed himself saying: 'I think every girl is a type of s***, they are fussy with men nowadays, they do not give boys like us a chance. 'I am still a virgin, everyone is losing it before me, that's why you are my chosen target. I just can't live in this flat, I have no future here. So women, tell me how we should do this.' Ms Maylin said he also kept what he called a 'diary of evil' which detailed the attacks, as well as a document listing his dreams, which included descriptions of violence against women and of killing. A police officer stands guard at the scene of one of Moynihan's stabbings in July last year . Ms Maylin added: 'Ben Moynihan had an incomprehensible fascination for killing and he would compare himself to serial killers.' In a victim impact statement, the 20-year-old victim said: 'In the days and weeks immediately after the attack, I felt very scared. I couldn't go out on my own. I just wanted to stay inside. 'I often get flashbacks of that dreadful night and when I'm walking alone I have to keep looking back behind me just in case someone is there. I don't trust strangers, I often look at where their hands are placed.' The 67-year-old woman said in her statement: 'I used to be a confident public speaker as part of my work but I feel I will never be able to do this again. 'My life was completely turned upside down, I did not ask for this change, it was forced upon me by my attacker.' In mitigation, Robert Bryan described Moynihan as a 'young impressionable man' and pointed out that none of the injuries were life threatening injuries despite what he said in his videos. Another stabbing occurred in Cosham, Portsmouth. Pictured are forensics officers searching the scene . Police comb through woodland in Hilsea, Portsmouth, following Moynihan's June stabbing . Police launched a public appeal in the wake of the stabbings in an attempt to hunt down Moynihan . Mr Bryan said: 'When considering his behaviour he, having learnt that on the first occasion there were no life threatening injuries, at no stage thereafter did he increase the ferocity of his attacks or attempt to attack in some other way. 'He had the intent but it may be that his heart wasn't quite into it. He didn't carry out any of the matters the he set out to do in his video.

Nicholas Hunter was heard saying, 'The world is going to end tonight at midnight,' before he launched a random attack on James Fiennes. He  pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after psychiatrists agreed he was mentally ill at the time of the attack in April last year, and was sentenced to be detained indefinitely. Attack: James Fiennes, left, was killed in a bar by mentally ill stranger Nicholas Hunter, right . Mr Fiennes, 49, was an IT consultant and entrepreneur who was the second cousin of explorer Sir Ranulph and a distant relative of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes. The Old Bailey heard that on the evening of his death he had gone for a drink at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south-west London, near the flat where he spent half of each week. He was a regular at the bar, and was described by staff and customers as a 'quiet, polite, kind and generous man', said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC. She told the court that Hunter, 37, was working for an engineering company in Barnes run by his friend Thomas Olsen. His family have a 'genetic vulnerability' to mental illness and his maternal grandfather, his nephew and his brother have all been affected, Ms Johnson said. Killing: The attack took place at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south London in April 2014 . Investigation: A police officer outside the bar shortly after the tragic incident last year . In 2005 he moved with his wife to Hong Kong to work for Cathay Pacific, but in 2011 he resigned and returned to Britain after being diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. After his baby son was born in February 2014 Hunter reported feeling paranoid, suspicious and losing touch with reality, said Ms Johnson. 'He believed people were talking about him, following him and were going to kill him,' she added. On the day of the attack, Hunter bought a a pair of scissors from Sainsbury's during his lunch break and after work he went to Mr Olsen's home and suggested going for a drink. Shortly after he arrived at the bar he announced 'out of the blue' to Mr Olsen, 'I'm going to have a sex change', then added: 'I shouldn't have told you that, I'm going to kill you, the world is going to end at midnight tonight.' Hunter then appeared to notice Mr Fiennes and called out 'Hi James', even though he had not met the victim previously. Mr Fiennes approached him and asked how they knew each other, but Hunter just said: 'James, I'm going to have to kill you.' The attacker pulled out his scissors and stabbed Mr Fiennes repeatedly in a 'frenzied and unprovoked' attack, the court heard, before guests tackled him to the ground. Mr Olsen said the 'vicious' attack made it look 'as if he was possessed', the court was told. Relatives: Mr Fiennes was a distant cousin of explorer Ranulph Fiennes, left, and actor Ralph Fiennes, right . Mr Fiennes was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment but died five hours later after his wife Caroline and their two children rushed to London from the family home in Sherborne, Dorset. Hunter, originally from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said 'I have really f***ed up my life' after dropping the scissors in the bar. He later told investigators he did not know why he had killed Mr Fiennes, but said it had something to do with the end of the world. The killer was also unable to explain why he had greeted his victim by name, saying he had 'a complete explosion in his mind'. Hunter pleaded not guilty to murdering and threatening to kill Mr Olsen, but the Crown agreed to let the charges lie on file after he admitted manslaughter. Miss Johnson said: 'The psychiatrists are agreed that at the time the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning, namely schizo-affective disorder.' In a victim impact statement, Mrs Fiennes said: 'The day I met James I knew I would marry him. I loved him then, I love him now and I will love him forever. 'He was my best friend, my soulmate, my rock or oak tree. Everything a good husband could be, James was. 'He was kind, considerate, funny, gentle, spiritual and intelligent. Above all he was loving. Everyone and anyone who knew James described him as a gentleman in every sense of the world.' In a statement read out by his barrister Isabella Forshall QC, Hunter said: 'Words alone cannot express the sorrow I feel for the catastrophic situation I have caused to those affected. I think of them and I pray for them. 'I am so very sorry for the tragedy my actions have caused.' Miss Forshall said: 'If this man hadn't become mentally ill he would have continued to live a conscientious, thoughtful and valuable life.' Sentencing Hunter to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital, judge Gerald Gordon said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that your responsibility for what you did at the time by reason of your mental illness was so substantially reduced and caused by your mental health that that is the right course. 'I should stress that I have taken into account both the ferocity of the attack and that the person you attacked was a total stranger. 'This was indeed a serious, unprovoked attack upon a complete stranger resulting in his loss of life. It occurred without your having any violent history whatsoever and as a result of your mental illness.

And if one scientists gets his way, one of these searches could involve looking for dark matter - one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the cosmos. He proposes that the Higgs boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter, and he\u2019s hoping the team at Cern can prove his theory. Scroll down for video . Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson\u2019s model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter . Dr Christoffer Petersson from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and two colleagues came up with the new particle model to predict the existence of dark matter. The current \u2018Standard Model\u2019 of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level, but it can\u2019t account for dark matter in the universe. Dr Petersson\u2019s model, though, contains more \u2018elementary particles\u2019 - the smallest known to exist - than the Standard Model. This includes dark matter particles. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. And his model also gives the Higgs particle different properties, suggesting that it can disintegrate into a photon (a particle of light) and particles of dark matter. To prove his theory, though, he needs a particle accelerator - and it seems that Cern is willing to conduct such an experiment. Two independent experimental stations - Atlas and CMS - at the Large Hadron Collider are looking for the very properties of the Higgs particle his model predicts. If the properties are there, it is a clear indication that the model fits. \u2018It's a dream for a theorist in particle physics,\u2019 said Dr Petersson. \u2018[The] LHC is the only place where the model can be tested. It's even nicer that two independent experiments are going to do it.' The current \u2018Standard Model\u2019 of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level, but it can\u2019t account for dark matter in the universe (illustrated). Dr Petersson\u2019s model, though, contains more \u2018elementary particles\u2019 than the Standard Model - and crucially it includes dark matter particles . In May of this year the LHC will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years, as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before. Pictured is the Atlas experiment at the LHC, one of two instruments trying to prove - or disprove - Dr Petersson's model . In the first studies the volume of data was unfortunately too small for it to be possible to either confirm or reject Petersson's model. \u2018But we are already in full swing with new analyses in which we are testing his model in other ways and with more data,\u2019 said Dr Zeynap Demiragli at the CMS experiment at Cern. \u2018We congratulate Christoffer Petersson for having done an important job.\u2019 After being closed down for a time for an upgrade, LHC will start up again in the spring of 2015. With higher energies in the accelerator, the experiments will finally gather sufficient data to evaluate Dr Petersson's model properly. \u2018If the model is found to fit, it would completely change our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature,' he said.

Sarah Grant, received a \u00a340,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester crown court heard. The couple, of Cheltenham, claims the firms were in liquidation and deny falsely claiming pension credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit without declaring that they had other income. Couple accused:\u00a0Sarah and Leslie Grant allegedly\u00a0sent their children to a \u00a332,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost \u00a32,000 a month while claiming \u00a342,000 benefits . Prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of \u00a342,500 to which they were not entitled. 'While they were in receipt of those benefits they were managing to continue to pay for their children to go to Dean Close School in Cheltenham and to continue to pay for expensive child care and expensive rent,' she said. 'We say they received \u00a319,000 pension credit, \u00a319,000 housing benefit and \u00a34,500 council tax benefit to which they were not entitled. 'We say Mr and Mrs Grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the Department for Work and Pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits. 'The prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources. Between September 2010 and October 2011 Mrs Grant received \u00a340,000 from her parents. 'There was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which Mr Grant was running. 'And they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure. 'Money from those accounts that was not being declared was being used to pay personal bills, for example their expensive rent and school fees as well as for more day to day things such as shopping.' Top private school: The Grants' children attended \u00a332,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The three active companies of which she was a director were Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Developments and Sarafino Ltd, she said . The prosecutor said Mr Grant had been receiving pension credit from November 2007 yet he was running the companies of which his wife was director. Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay \u00a31,950 a month rent while receiving housing allowance of only \u00a3775 a month, added Ms Wolfe. Mrs Grant was questioned by a benefits official in May 2010 and said her parents had paid the rent shortfall and school fees. She claimed the money paid to her by the companies was to reimburse her for expenses she had paid for the businesses from her personal account. Mrs Grant has held the position of director at eight different companies founded in the last seven years. On trial: Speaking at Gloucester Crown Court (above), prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about \u00a342,500 to which they were not entitled . As well as the three mentioned in court, she was associated with Carousel Group Cheltenham, Sarafinos Estates, Clayhills Development, The Belgian Chocolate Company and D'Altos. All are now listed online as dissolved or in liquidation. Mr Grant was seen in October 2011 and 'spoke a lot about bankruptcy proceedings and legal proceedings in respect of money owed to him,' added the prosecutor. When they had filled out benefit application forms she had said she was a director but the companies were in liquidation. Both defendants, seen leaving court together side-by-side today, say the businesses were not a going concern and both said they did not work. The trial continues tomorrow.

The former Real Madrid midfielder has suffered a severe slump in form after a bright start to life at Old Trafford and was even hooked at half-time by the United boss against Sunderland last week. Sportsmail's man in Madrid Pete Jenson, who kept a close eye on Di Maria during his four-year spell in the Spanish capital, assures United fans the \u00a360million man will come good. Angel di Maria was substituted against Sunderland after a poor performance in the opening 45 minutes . Louis van Gaal claimed it may take record signing Di Maria a full year to adapt to English football . When it comes to putting his medals on the table Angel di Maria has the silverware to silence the critics. He also has the references to convince Manchester United supporters that his current dip in form will soon pass. Jose Mourinho signed him; Carlo Anclelotti stuck by him; Sir Alex Ferguson handed him his man of the match award after the 2014 Champions League final; and Real Madrid team-mates all knew he would be missed when he left the club last summer. Xabi Alonso tweeted when he was sold: \u2018Thanks for everything. I wish you all the best, even if you are going to United. We will never forget the zig-zag in extra-time in Lisbon.\u2019 That message refers to the run and shot that led to Gareth Bale putting Real Madrid ahead against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. It was the perfect end to his best season at a club where he was also instrumental in winning a Spanish Cup under Ancelotti and the league and another Spanish Cup under Mourinho. Di Maria has had a difficult season after making a fast start to life at Old Trafford following his move . The midfielder had a particularly bad afternoon against Sunderland last week before being hooked . It should be remembered that his glorious last campaign also came with a mid-season glitch. He famously grabbed his crotch in a disrespectful snub to Ancelotti and the booing Bernabeu after being substituted during a game at the start of the year. There was pressure on the coach to put Gareth Bale on the right wing ahead of the Argentine and feeling he was being edged out of the side unfairly in spite of a good start to the season he reacted. Ancelotti did not ostracise him as many demanded, instead he reinvented him. Moving him from the right of Real\u2019s front three to the left of their midfield three, there he became La Liga\u2019s top assist provider. He played 22 passes leading to goals last season including one that helped win the Spanish Cup and one that helped secure the Champions League. Carlo Ancelotti stuck with Di Maria during a slump and he eventually helped them win Champions League . Di Maria played a starring role during the Champions League final against Atletico last season . Di Maria celebrated with the European Cup before he moved to Manchester United last summer . It is that willingness and versatility that first attracted Mourinho and he made him one of his first signings at Real Madrid for \u00a320m from Benfica. The signing was not an outright success as Barcelona continued to dominate in Spain. Di Maria played in the first Pep Guardiola v Mourinho clasico in November 2010 and was as culpable as any of his team-mates as Madrid went down 5-0 in one of the worst humiliations of the Portuguese manager's career. But Di Maria never stopped going in that first season and the following March at Mestalla in the Spanish Cup final, also against Barcelona, it was a lung-busting run from Di Maria in minute 103 and a cross to the back post headed in by Cristiano Ronaldo that gave Mourinho his first trophy in Spain. The following year Di Maria helped his boss win the league. Di Maria made an exciting start to his career at Old Trafford, pictured here celebrating a goal against QPR . The midfiedler also scored against Everton and all three of his league goals were scored by early October . Mourinho\u2019s judgement is rarely off and the same can be said for Ancelotti's. He knew not to discard Di Maria just because Bale had arrived, channelling his qualities for the good of the team. Real are missing him now. Last season Luka Modric and Di Maria protected Real full backs Marcelo and Dani Carvajal leaving Bale and Ronaldo to concentrate on the business of terrorising opposition defences. This year with the Argentine sold and Modric injured they are, by their own standards, struggling with Ronaldo and particularly Bale, criticised for not working back in defence. A first-season dip after a brilliant start is also nothing new for a player in his first season in the Premier League. Mesut Ozil suffered the same at Arsenal after his high-profile move from Real Madrid and Di Maria has more excuses than most to have dropped his performances levels. Di Maria played a key role for Argentina as they reached the final of the World Cup in Brazil last summer . The former Real midfielder starred for Argentina in a 4-2 win against Germany in September . He played 52 of Real Madrid\u2019s 60 games last season and then played a big part in Argentina\u2019s World Cup campaign. He might have foreseen a more relaxing season this time but he had to move his family to Manchester from Madrid in the summer and has the added stress of a further temporary move into a hotel after the recent attempted burglary at his Cheshire home. That and Van Gaal\u2019s failure to find the magic formula on the pitch and his preference for a more patient passing game has not helped the 27-year-old\u2019s cause. His anarchic road-runner raids forward are a poor fit for the tactical straight-jacket Van Gaal occasionally imposes on his players. Being hooked at half-time against Sunderland does not look good on Di Maria\u2019s resume but alongside his Olympic Gold medal (scoring the winner in the final) his Champions League medal and the glowing references from Mourinho and Ancelotti, there is more than enough to remind everyone that while his current form is off, his class will eventually shine through.", "label": 0.31730770133435726, "predicted": 0.39444872736930847}, "175": {"text": "50 Shades of Grey exploded onto the market in Australia, smashing book sale and box office records with it's tale of the pursuit of pleasure that scandalised some and fascinated others.

Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, announced Monday that she will not run for re-election. 'Do I spend my time raising money, or do I spend my time raising hell?' the 78-year-old old Maryland Democrat, now in her fifth term, said she asked herself when deliberating whether to seek a sixth term next year. 'I don't want to spend my time campaigning for me. I want to campaign for the people,' she said at a news conference in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore. 'Do I spend my time promising what I would do \u2013 or do it now and do it the way I like to?' Senate Appropriations Committee Ranking Democrat Barbara Mikulski, a Marylander shown in 2012, announced that her plans for the future don't include Congress . The diminutive Mikulski, seen standing on a box behind a Senate podium, castigated Republicans on Feb. 24 for refusing to pass a Homeland Security funding bill without a string attached that would de-fund the persident's executive actions on immigration . Mikulski, a tough, no-nonsense lawmaker who rose to the leadership of the powerful Appropriations Committee, became the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress in 2012. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and has served in the Senate since 1987. She said that when her term has ended, 'I will know that I will have given it my best shot.' Her retirement is certain to set off a race among potential candidates to succeed her, including Democratic Reps.\u00a0Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, and former Govs. Martin O'Malley, who is considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Republican Bob Ehrlich. She becomes the second Senate Democratic woman to announce her retirement this year, following Barbara Boxer of California. In a 2014 interview, Mikulski said her approach as chair of the Appropriations panel was 'to focus with civility and courtesy. Old school values. Don't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press.' In her state, she has been fiercely protective of the environment, especially Chesapeake Bay issues. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described Mikulski at the time as forceful and results-oriented. 'I think she's terrific,' he said. Mikulski had been seen as more engaging and approachable than her predecessors as appropriations chairman, the late Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Daniel Inouye, Hawaii, both Democrats. She had spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties, learning their needs and end goals. After a short tenure as chairman, she now is the top Democrat on the panel after Republicans captured control of the Senate in last November's elections. 'She knows that if you know somebody and what they want, you can help them be successful.\u00a0And when you help people be successful, Republicans or Democrats, that's how you move bills,' said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Mikulski protege. Mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women. The Maryland senator sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill in an April 2014 floor showdown. 'When I hear all these phony reasons, some are mean and some are meaningless, I do get emotional,' Mikulski said of arguments against the legislation. 'I get angry. I get outraged. I get volcanic.' Mikulski played off former CIA Director Michael Hayden's recent comment that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, was motivated by 'emotional feeling' when she sought an investigation of the spy agency's harsh treatment of terrorism suspects .", "label": 0.17647059308364987, "predicted": 0.4066653847694397}, "177": {"text": "Really, the only surprise was that it took him three touches.

So much for the cries for patience. Here was goal No 30 of the season for a young man who simply cannot stop scoring. Twenty nine for his club and now one for his country at senior level. Raheem Sterling clipped an inviting ball up to the back post, where Kane\u2019s instinct had taken him. There was just a thin slice of goal to aim for, but he was never missing.

Somehow, it all seemed preordained, as if you could have tied up Kane\u2019s bootlaces, blindfolded him, sat him on a chair in the centre of the penalty area and he would still have scored somehow. The 21-year-old Tottenham striker, who has been on fire in the Barclays Premier League, was off and running in international football 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney. Who needs time to adjust? This was the third-fastest goal by an England debutant and the quickest since Bill Nicholson in 1951. Quite understandably, Kane could barely control his delight, pushing the referee aside as he sprinted into to a jubilant knee-slide by the corner flag while the Wembley crowd leapt to hail their newest hero. All this was quite surreal. No wonder he described it as \u2018just a blur\u2019. The fourth goal of an easy win against a team ranked 94th in the world in the midst of a humdrum campaign has no right to command such excitement but it is impossible not to be swept along by this incredible story. Until then it had all been about Rooney\u2019s steady pursuit of Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s England goal record and Danny Welbeck\u2019s wonderful display of attacking verve, which rightly earned him the man-of-the-match vote. Rooney needed less than six minutes to score the opener and might have had more on a night when he hit the woodwork twice in the first half. England\u2019s second was probably an own goal but was claimed by Welbeck, who deserved it in a way for a display which justified Hodgson\u2019s decision to select him and leave Kane on the bench for three-quarters of the game. Sterling converted the third \u2014 his first international goal \u2014 timing his run to perfection and tucking away Rooney\u2019s cross from the right. It meant England had secured their fifth successive win in Group E long before Kane came on to thrill Wembley. Hodgson will reflect on the game with satisfaction. His team are six points clear with one foot already across the Channel at Euro 2016, and promising young players like Kane are forcing their way into contention.

Rooney is all smiles after Welbeck made it 2-0 just before the half-time whistle . Kane and Gary Cahill greet each other following the final whistle with England maintaining a six-point cushion at the top of Group E . The manager will also have been content with his team\u2019s balance and shape, which flexed from a 4-1-4-1 into a classic 4-3-3 when England had the ball. Michael Carrick sat in front of the centre halves and supplied a trio of mobile strikers, while Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph covered the midfield miles. It will be different in a tougher game when Carrick is expected to shield his back four, but here is the perennial problem. England need one method to qualify \u2014 breaking down teams who surrender possession and offer no ambition \u2014 and an entirely different one when they reach the finals and come up against more clinical and potent opposition. Lithuania started nervously at Wembley and Hodgson\u2019s team were smart enough to take advantage. Rooney hit the inside of a post having been released by Delph, before scoring his 47th England goal with a simple header after Arlauskis had pushed a fine effort from Welbeck into the air. England\u2019s captain hit the other post midway through the first half. Again, Welbeck created it, this time by driving to the by-line and picking out Rooney at the far post. His header was firmly sent back from whence it came, as in the textbooks, and Wembley held its breath as it looped through the air and hit the frame of the goal. Fabian Delph was denied a first goal in an England shirt as his crisp volley was repelled by an excellent reflex save from\u00a0Arlauskis . Roy Hodgson will be a very happy man after another convincing win with four different scorers and another clean sheet . Sterling and\u00a0Vytautas Andriuskevicius collided in what looked like a 50/50 challenge and the England man was unfortunate to be booked . Nathaniel Clyne clears the ball upfield despite pressure from Saulius Mikoliunas as England launch another attack . As England began to wonder if they would extend their lead, they enjoyed a little luck by way of a scruffy second. Henderson worked a short corner with Leighton Baines and delivered an inswinging cross towards Welbeck, who stooped and skewed a glancing header off his shoulder which was deflected into the net from the right thigh of Lithuania captain Tadas Kijanskas. It was swiftly declared as Welbeck\u2019s goal, and the Arsenal striker seemed happy to claim it. Arlauskis reacted well to keep out Delph\u2019s volley after the break and Welbeck deserved a penalty as England dominated. Sterling, who grew into the game and was far more influential as Lithuania tired, celebrated his first international goal by tucking in a cross from Rooney via the near post. And then Kane appeared to a raucous reception. This crowd believed the hype. They had cheered through his warm-up routine and they demanded a goal as he sprinted on. No sweat. He promptly delivered. It wasn\u2019t an easy finish. But it was never really in doubt, was it? On the bench, Rooney stood to applaud and like everyone else present, he could not help but smile and shake his head.

At a sentence hearing at Sydney's District Court on Tuesday, Simone Farrow said her mother told her when she was a teenager it was OK to be a prostitute. The 39-year-old, who is also known as Simone Cheung and by her professional name Simone Starr, was arrested in October 2009 by Australian Federal Police on her return from the United States. Scroll down for video . Former Penthouse Pet Simone Farrow (pictured) has broken down in court after revealing her extreme addiction to the drug 'ice' It is alleged Farrow smuggled methylamphetamine inside bath products and 'large sums' had been transferred into her bank account. Farrow said she abused prescription drugs and smoked ice daily while in the US. 'I couldn't basically function unless I smoked it,' she said. The former model became emotional while describing her childhood, saying her mother used to lock her in a room and alleged she had taken her to a brothel when she was 17 and told her 'it was okay to do that work'. When she was 20, Farrow said she worked at an escort agency. While at the business she claimed a man whom she 'gave all my money to', held her by her feet over the edge of an apartment at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney's east. Given her mother's lifestyle, which allegedly involved bouncing between partners and taking drugs, Farrow said she thought she believed she was 'a mistake'. 'I don't have any brothers and sisters,' she said. Farrow, who suffers from a range of mental health issues, including bipolar and depression, said she's proud of being drug free for the two years and seven months she's spent in custody. The 39-year-old, who is also known as Simone Cheung and by her professional name Simone Starr, was arrested in October 2009 by Australian Federal Police on her return from the United States . On September 13, 2013, Farrow pleaded guilty to importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug. She denied that she was an international leader of a drug ring and claimed she had been set up. In court she said she was unknowingly set up by some employees who had obtained complete control of her bank, phone and email accounts and ran the drug ring behind her back. Ms Farrow's lawyer told the court that if buyers believed she was behind the syndicate, it was because her employees would have imitated her way of speaking in order to pass off as her. Farrow was looking noticeably less glamorous as she was led into court in handcuffs after her arrest . The Australian Federal Police arrested Ms Farrow in 2012 at the Gold Coast before extraditing her to Sydney. Prosecutors maintain that she controlled the drug ring while pursuing a career in the United States as Simone Starr. Prosecutors claim they have video footage of Ms Farrow smoking drugs and claimed in court she personally intimidated buyers who owed her thousands of dollars by threatening to send bikies to manhandle them. The court also heard from a number of Farrows buyers who claimed they dealt directly with her, paying her $7000 per ounce. Farrow was a jet-setter, splitting her time between Australia's Gold Coast and a luxury apartment in Hollywood, California .

Its presence has potentially been spotted in a dwarf matter orbiting the Milky Way which is radiating gamma rays - the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe. How these mysterious waves are made, and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years, but scientists believe they are a sign for dark matter. Scroll down for video . Scientists at Brown, Carnegie Mellon, and Cambridge universities have detected gamma ray emissions from the direction of the galaxy Reticulum 2. Bright areas indicate a strong gamma ray signal coming from the direction of the galaxy, according to the researchers\u2019 search algorithm . Dark matter is the missing substance that makes up to 80 per cent of the universe's mass. It has been described as 'the most important unsolved problems in modern physics.' When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. The galaxy, named Reticulum 2, was discovered within the past few weeks in the data of the Dark Energy Survey. At 98,000 light-years from Earth, Reticulum 2 is one of the nearest dwarf galaxies yet detected . According to physicists at Carnegie Mellon, Brown and Cambridge universities, gamma rays coming from the direction of the galaxy are in excess of what would be expected from normal background. 'Something in the direction of this dwarf galaxy is emitting gamma rays,' said Alex Geringer-Sameth, a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University. 'There's no conventional reason this galaxy should be giving off gamma rays, so it's potentially a signal for dark matter,' said Alex Geringer-Sameth, a postdoctoral research associate in CMU's Department of Physics and the paper's lead author. 'In the search for dark matter, gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature,' added Brown University's Savvas Koushiappas Koushiappas, an assistant professor of physics. 'It seems like we may now be detecting such a thing for the first time.' The researchers caution that while these preliminary results are exciting, there's more work to be done to confirm a dark matter origin. Scientists know that dark matter exists because it exerts gravitational effects on visible matter, which explains the observed rotation of galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. Dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle. They are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources, so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter. Pictured is an artist's impression of the jet from a gamma-ray burst emerging at nearly light speed . 'The gravitational detection of dark matter tells you very little about the particle behaviour of the dark matter,' said Matthew Walker, assistant professor of physics and a member of CMU's McWilliams Center for Cosmology. Gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature of dark matter. A leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. When pairs of WIMPs meet, they annihilate one another, giving off high-energy gamma rays. If that's true, then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where WIMPs are thought to be plentiful, like the dense centres of galaxies. 'But now we may have a non-gravitational detection that shows dark matter behaving like a particle, which is a holy grail of sorts.' A leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. When pairs of WIMPs meet, they annihilate one another, giving off high-energy gamma rays. If that's true, then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where WIMPs are thought to be plentiful, like the dense centres of galaxies. The trouble is, the high-energy rays also originate from many other sources, including black holes and pulsars, which makes it difficult to untangle a dark matter signal from the background noise. That's why dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle. They are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources, so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter. 'They're basically very clean and quiet systems,' Professor Koushiappas said. Scientists have been looking at them for signs of gamma rays for the last several years using Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. There's never been a convincing signal, until now. Further study of this dwarf galaxy's attributes could reveal hidden sources that may be emitting gamma rays, but the researchers are cautiously optimistic. 'The fact that there are gamma rays and also a clump of dark matter in the same direction makes it quite interesting,' Professor Walker said.", "label": 0.484375, "predicted": 0.6003772616386414}, "184": {"text": "Next stop the Masters for Rory McIlroy and let's hope his final competitive hole before the season's first major in just over a fortnight's time proves a portent of things to come. Taking dead aim with his second shot on the dangerous 18th hole at Bay Hill on Sunday, the world No 1 judged it beautifully. The eight iron approach finished just 6ft from the hole and he rapped home the birdie putt for a 70 for a tied 11th finish in his first appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where American Matt Every completed a successful title defence. Given McIlroy climbed to within a stroke of the lead on Friday with a run of five birdies in a row during his second round 66, it hardly represented the summit of his ambitions for the weekend. Rory McIlroy finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Matt Every (left) celebrates winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational and is given the trophy by the man himself . American champion Every made a successful defence of the trophy at Bay Hill on Sunday . But the tournament was really all about prep work ahead of his attempt to become the first European to complete the career Grand Slam and in those terms, he pronounced himself content. 'I feel like I got what I wanted out of the week and saw some progress on the things I am working on between now and Augusta,' he said. 'Now I'll go away and work on them some more and hopefully be ready for the Masters.' That work will be completed at the Bear's Club near his home in South Florida, where the greens will be a lot closer to Augusta speed than those at Bay Hill last week, where he never really looked comfortable. As for the Masters, McIlroy said: 'I'm excited with it now so close, and the chance to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth player to complete the career grand slam. It is a nice position to be in and I am going to embrace it.' McIlroy began seven shots off the lead and threatened briefly to assemble the sort of final round charge that saw him make up just such a deficit to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth last year. Stenson threw away a golden opportunity to win Palmer's tournament . Ian Poulter also had a disappointing weekend as he finished outside the top 20 . He birdied the two par fives, the fourth and sixth, and looked certain to birdie the 8th but the putt somehow failed to drop. McIlroy bent over in exasperation and at the next his race was run in terms of winning when he ran up an untidy bogey. It looked as if the round would fizzle out but he assembled something of a grandstand finish with two birdies in his last three holes. Alongside McIlroy, Europe's other leading hope for a first Masters triumph in 16 years must be the Swede Henrik Stenson but he will be smarting right now after throwing away a golden opportunity to win Palmer's tournament. After two fourth place finishes in a row in Florida, he began the final round with a two stroke lead. After losing it on the front nine owing largely to some forceful attacking play from Americans Morgan Hoffmann and Every, he had regained it with four holes to play. The only thing that has ever held him back, however, has been his putting and his weakness showed up again with successive three putts at the 15th and 16th holes. How costly that proved as Every played a marvellous iron shot to the 18th to set up what proved the clinching birdie. Stenson could not match it to give the unsung Floridian a one shot win.

A bit of media work, plenty of endorsements and a range of bikes, available at good stockists everywhere. He has reportedly turned down Strictly but this week he joined Frank Lampard as a sporting star with his own range of children's books. Flying Fergus are the tales of a young boy who discovers a old rusty bike has magic powers that transport him to sporting success. In the build-up to London 2012, it was Hoy's rivals who wondered whether he and the British team had 'magic wheels', though the truth was his six Olympic golds were achieved by an unmatched will to win and 27 inch thighs that powered him like pistons to sporting history. Chris Hoy celebrates an impressive cycling career with the Great Britain flag after yet more success . British cyclist Hoy poses during the reception for Team GB and Paralympic GB athletes in London . Hoy's legacy is a cycling revolution that has changed the British sporting landscape but it has also created an expectation that success is now assured forever. In Beijing - when Hoy won three medals in a singles Games - Britain won seven from ten golds, a feat that that prompted cycling's governing body to change the rules for London to prevent such domination. And yet, three summers ago, Britain again won seven from ten Olympic titles, including two more golds for Hoy. Hoy celebrates after crossing the finish line to win the gold medal in the London 2012 Olympic Games . However, at the recent track cycling World Championships, British cyclists failed to top the podium in a single event - their worst performance in 14 years. They ranked tenth on the medal table with a haul of just three silver medals, their coach, Shane Sutton, later questioning their hunger to succeed. Anyone who witnessed Hoy's final and most thrilling Olympic gold in the men's keirin will know that timing is his strong point. And it certainly seems like he got out at the right time. Hoy celebrates winning the Men's Keirin final on day eleven of the Olympic Games in London . However, the 11-time world champion insists it's not really as grim as the statistics appear. Some think the team has been missing a leader since his retirement and Hoy believes the return to the track of Sir Bradley Wiggins could be just what's needed to lift the spirits. 'He's an iconic leader and other nations look to him as this global cycling megastar,' he said. 'When he's in the track centre everybody's focusing on him, so it takes the pressure and spotlight off some of the other riders who don't particularly enjoy that attention. He's invaluable for the team as a whole. 'We lost a bit of experience after the Olympics, after Victoria Pendleton and I retired. Success creates its own problems and pressures. Now, if you're the British Olympic Team going into Rio, you've a realistic chance of medalling in maybe 60 per cent of the events. 'But in cycling now, unless it's a gold medal, it is seen as being a massive failure and you've got to manage expectations. 'We do still have realistic chances but I don't think we'll have another Beijing or London but I don't think that's a massive surprise or disappointment. I still think we have a successful Games in Rio but with less medals than previous Games. 'The World Championships in Paris was disappointing, there's no way you can spin it to make it sound like a success, as a team it wasn't.

He is not quite a No 9, not entirely a No 10. He is a creative type who scores goals under the watchful eye of Real coach Zinedine Zidane. So far this season he has scored three goals for Real in the UEFA Youth League and is midway through a five-year deal signed in 2012. Born in Fuengirola, near Malaga, the 18-year-old is Spanish. And Spain\u2019s Under-19 coach Luis de la Fuente has used his birth certificate to try to recruit him. Marvellously, however, Harper does not want to play for Spain. His parents are from Barrhead. He wants to play for Scotland. Incredibly, Scotland seems less keen on him. Sbragia\u2019s Under-19 squad are currently preparing for UEFA European Championships elite round with games against Austria, Italy and Croatia this week. And Harper, dubbed a \u2018luxury\u2019 player, is nowhere to be found. In a throwback to the old school thinking which preceded the SFA\u2019s high-profile 2020 performance strategy, Sbragia explains his absence by saying: \u2018Our concentration is on the opening game with Austria and we\u2019ve deliberately got more height in our squad. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Jack isn\u2019t in. Highly rated forward Harper has already been linked with moves to Manchester United and Liverpool . \u2018The last time he was with us, he did okay, but I wanted a little more impact. At Real Madrid, he can float all over the place. But with us, he has to be more disciplined. \u2018It\u2019s purely tactical and there certainly hasn\u2019t been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.\u2019 There might be now, of course. Most of all when Harper learns that young Oliver McBurnie, an 18-year-old striker who plays for Bradford City is in the squad. Currently McBurnie, six foot two in his stocking soles, is on loan at Chester City \u2013 a non-league club in the English Conference Premier. Within the SFA, there is a recognition of how damaging and old-fashioned all this looks. Regarded as a progressive, forward thinking and intelligent coach within the corridors of Hampden, Sbragia\u2019s quotes on Harper hint at something else. For McClair, a cerebral former Manchester United colleague of Sbragia\u2019s, the Harper conundrum represents an early test of his diplomatic skills. Scotland boss Gordon Strachan \u2013 no giant himself \u2013 washed his hands of the matter on Tuesday, saying: \u2018I\u2019m not involved in that at all. I let the other guys get on with it. I\u2019ve no idea if it\u2019s physical or whatever.\u2019 Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future . Pointing out that most of the country has never seen Harper play, Strachan added: \u2018I\u2019ve seen a few people at Chelsea who never get a game anywhere. They go on loan somewhere and disappear into no man\u2019s land.\u2019 That was the fate of Feruz \u2013 the \u2018wonderkid\u2019 who turned his back on Scotland and was last heard of having a loan deal at Blackpool cancelled. Before leaving his post last October, Wotte urged Scottish youth football to rid itself of the \u2018win at all costs\u2019 mentality and develop skills. An appeal which fell on deaf ears with at least one SFA colleague. \u2018We have to match these teams physically,\u2019 said Sbragia of the challenge facing his under-19 side. \u2018The more I\u2019m seeing games, the more I see things going back to physicality and the height factor.\u2019 The irony, of course, is that Harper is no midget. He is six foot tall. Taller than Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy, the Glasgow-born Everton stars allowed to slip through the SFA\u2019s fingers and play for the Republic of Ireland instead. The worry is that when the SFA host European Championship games at Hampden in 2020, the nation will finally get the chance to see the prodigious talent of Jack Harper.

Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes ahead of Wednesday\u2019s naming of the party for a three-Test series against the West Indies that Peter Moores desperately needs to win if he is to remain England coach. Moeen and Woakes were injured towards the end of England\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first Test in Antigua on April 13 that follows two warm-up games in St Kitts. Zafar Ansari could be named as part of the England squad ahead of the three-Test series against West Indies . The 23-year-old is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey . The 23-year-old Zafar Ansari is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey. IS HE ANY GOOD? Just ask Kevin Pietersen! So often a victim of left-arm spin, the former England batsman was dismissed by a 19-year-old Ansari as Cambridge University beat Surrey by 10 wickets in 2011. Ansari has 54 first-class wickets and a batting average of 30.16. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW? Ansari would probably be among the smarter cricketers in England\u2019s tour party, having studied politics at Cambridge. He admits he is often ribbed by his team-mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room. That means Surrey\u2019s left-arm spin-bowling all-rounder Ansari and Durham pace bowler Wood could be named to travel with the squad as cover for Moeen and Woakes in the early days of the month-long tour. Ansari, 23, is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to Moeen on the circuit. Wood impressed England\u2019s outgoing fast bowling coach David Saker during a training camp in South Africa before Christmas and only fitness concerns have held the 25-year-old back from full international recognition. It seems certain that Jonathan Trott, now returned to full fitness after leaving England\u2019s last Ashes tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety, will return after a successful tour of South Africa as Lions captain. England\u2019s Test middle order is settled following the success of Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell in the three successive victories over India last summer, leaving Trott to battle Sam Robson to become Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner. Mark Wood (centre) could also be included in England's test squad to face the West Indies . Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali (pictured) ahead of the Test series . Peter Moores desperately needs England to defeat the West Indies if he is to remain coach . Cook, sacked as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup, returns to action for MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi starting on Sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by England in Test cricket last summer. Jonny Bairstow, one of the casualties of the fall-out from the last Ashes, is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of Kent\u2019s exciting Sam Billings, while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell will compete for the other spin place. Rashid, a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the England squad prematurely in 2009, looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the Lions in South Africa and may now be pipped by the more reliable Tredwell. Such is the desperate state of English cricket after the World Cup that the pressure will be on not just Moores but also managing director Paul Downton when England take on a West Indies side who look sure to be weakened by the Indian Premier League. Chris Gayle, for one, is likely to retire from international cricket after the World Cup and West Indies should be even more vulnerable than England.

Prior to Tuesday's Barclays Premier League clash between the teams, Sherwood - a contender to take over as Baggies boss in the recent past - described Albion as a 'good little club' before expressing his delight at having landed the manager's job at a 'massive football club' like Villa. Then, after his side won 2-1 in the game at Villa Park, Sherwood again made an apparent dig at West Brom, saying they will 'have to improve' for the next meeting - Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at the same venue - if they are going stop the hosts triumphing again. West Brom manager Tony Pulis insists he does not have a problem with Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood . Sherwood said West Brom were a 'good little club' ahead of Aston Villa's 2-1 win against the Baggies . But Pulis said ahead of this weekend's derby: 'That is Tim - there are no problems with me or the chairman at all. 'Tim is Tim and he will be good fun for everyone around the West Midlands for the time he is at Aston Villa I'm sure.' Pulis stressed West Brom will not need to use either the words of Sherwood, for whom the win on Tuesday was his first since taking the Villa post last month, or the disappointment of their defeat in that game to generate any additional motivation for Saturday's contest. With his players only one match away from a Wembley semi-final, Pulis - a beaten FA Cup finalist in 2011 as Stoke boss - said: 'I don't need to pin that (Sherwood's comments) up in the changing room. 'We have a good group of lads here and they will want to win the game as much as Villa will. 'I don't think we need any (extra) motivation. It's a local derby, it's the quarter-final of the FA Cup and it's absolutely wonderful that we've got to this stage. These are big games that everybody should look forward to and we will certainly be looking forward to it. 'We've got as good a chance (of winning the competition) as any of the eight teams left in there. 'You go and ask Bradford. They will fancy winning it as well.' West Brom defeated non-league side Gateshead 7-0 in Pulis' first official game in charge of the Baggies . Pulis' first game officially in charge of West Brom following his appointment in January was the 7-0 FA Cup third-round victory over non-league Gateshead at the Hawthorns.

For four years, mother-of-three Lisa Pigram went back and forth to her GP, complaining of wheeziness and occasional sharp pains in her shoulder and chest. Sometimes, she felt as though she was struggling to breathe, or that she was coming down with the flu. Yet she was 'just pooh-poohed' by doctors, says Lisa, 42, who lives in Essex with her husband and has three children, aged 22, 13 and eight. She was not sent for tests, and one doctor even insinuated that it was all in her mind and she was just 'a bit sensitive'. It was after she coughed up blood on holiday in 2004 - and still the doctor told her to wait and see if it got worse - that she decided to use her private medical insurance. Lisa, a teaching assistant, saw a specialist, who inserted a tube with a camera into her lungs and found a growth in her airways. She had a grape-sized bronchial carcinoid tumour - the same condition that the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson announced he had this weekend. The news came as a shock. Like Robinson, Lisa, 42, had never smoked - and no one could explain why she had developed it. She was told the tumour was essentially 'benign' and that if they removed it surgically, that would be the end of it. So, in May 2005, she had a section of her top lung cut out. Nick Robinson, 51, followed up the announcement of his cancer with typical good humour: . 'Timing lousy. Prognosis good,' he quipped. Indeed, the prognosis for most people with his form of cancer is very good if the tumour is caught early and surgically removed. Bronchial carcinoid tumours are a form of cancer known as neuroendocrine tumours. These form on the endocrine system, a network of glands and cells throughout the body that produces hormones. They can be found elsewhere in the body, mainly the intestines, the pancreas and the appendix - 10 to 20 per cent occur in the lungs. Every year, 3,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour. 'It is far less aggressive than many other cancers and even people with an advanced form can live for decades - Steve Jobs had a pancreatic form and lived for a long time with it,' says Neil Pearce, a surgeon who leads the team treating neuroendocrine tumours at University Hospital, Southampton. Jobs, the Apple boss, was diagnosed in 2003 and died in 2011. The news came as a shock for both BBC journalist Nick Robinson (pictured) and Lisa - as neither of them had ever smoked . The difference between typical lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid is that the former occurs within the main cells of the lung; bronchoid carcinoids occur in the neuroendocrine cells dotted around the lining of the main airways. Wherever a neuro-endocrine tumour develops, it can begin to produce hormones - and 30 per cent do so, resulting in a range of symptoms. The type of hormone produced varies significantly, but tumours in the lungs tend to produce either ACTH, which regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol, or serotonin, which can affect gut function, mood and the dilation of blood vessels. If tumours produce serotonin, this causes flushing, diarrhoea and wheezing. But these vague symptoms can make a neuroendocrine tumour more difficult to diagnose and, often, they are only picked up by chance, says Catherine Bouvier of the Net Patient Foundation. 'In around 20 per cent of cases, they are detected either at A&E, as the patient has become very ill, or by chance when they go for a routine health check,' she says. Diagnosis is made more difficult by the fact that non-smokers often don't think that they can get lung cancer. 'We don't actually know what causes it - it is a total mystery, but it does not seem to be associated with smoking,' says Mr Pearce. In fact, while smoking is by far the most common cause of the 43,000 cases of lung cancer each year, 14 per cent of people who develop it will not be smokers. Lisa says her future is now uncertain and she is worried about her children . The type of lung cancer most heavily linked to smoking is squamous cell, yet even this can affect non-smokers. 'What we think happens with lung cancer is that smoking irritates the airways and this causes the cells there to change,' says Professor Keith Prowse, honorary medical director of the British Lung Foundation. 'In cases where people have not even had this connection with cigarette smoke, there is a suggestion that it may be linked to atmospheric pollution.' Some may also be genetically more prone to lung cancer. Almost all lung cancers cause similar symptoms. 'Patients get infection-type symptoms, such as a cough, coughing up blood or wheezing. The difficulty is, some of these symptoms also occur with other conditions, such as asthma,' says Professor Prowse. The lung is also a large organ - lay it out flat and it is as big as a tennis court. Getting a diagnosis relies on taking a biopsy from the right part. The good news is that for 70 per cent of those who are diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid, the condition can be 'cured' simply by removing it surgically, says Professor Prowse. And here in the UK, we have more centres of excellence for treating this than anywhere in Europe, says Mr Pearce. 'However, not every patient with a neuroendocrine tumour gets seen by a specialist in one of these centres,' he adds. Lisa is one of the unlucky ones. After her surgery in 2005, she was discharged without any follow-up scans or investigations. She thought the experience was behind her and, the next year, went on to have another baby. Then, in 2010, she began to feel unwell. She couldn't quite put her finger on it - she had a bit of an upset stomach from time to time, daily acid indigestion, the odd palpitation and flushing. She also had pains in her chest. Lisa now knows this was caused by another tumour on her lung, pumping out hormones. When she initially went to her GP, she was told to cut out alcohol and given omeprazole, a drug to reduce her stomach acid. But eventually, in July 2012, she was sent for a scan. It revealed that the cancer had returned to the same lung. 'Suddenly, doctors started using the word cancer for the first time - I had no idea that was what I had, which came as a major shock to say the least,' says Lisa. The tumour is between two major blood vessels, and she has been told it is inoperable. The problem is that, aside from surgery, there is no cure for this cancer - as it is a slow-growing form of the disease, it does not respond to conventional chemotherapy, which targets cells with a rapid turnover. Proportion of lung cancer cases linked to\u00a0inadequate intake\u00a0of fruit and\u00a0veg . But there are drugs that can stop the tumour getting bigger, and nuclear medicine treatments, using radioactivity to target receptors on the tumour cells. Initially, Lisa was given hormone injections, called lanreotide, which she had to self-administer once a month. 'At first, it was great as it stopped my other symptoms such as an upset stomach. I was told that the cancer was stable, but I felt as if I had a ticking time-bomb inside me and dreaded going to my scans.' A recent scan showed her tumour had started to increase, and she now needs further follow-up scans to look at it in more detail. People often wrongly refer to this cancer as benign, says Mr Pearce. 'They say: \"Good news, it's a benign tumour\", then a few years later: \"Bad news, it's spread\". 'The cells can look benign down a microscope and that's why you need to see a specialist, because they will know how these really do behave - and they do spread, in 30 to 40 per cent of cases.' Lisa is very angry that neuroendocrine cancer is portrayed as almost 'harmless' and that while specialists say anyone with an endocrine tumour should be followed up, she was not - she has also been in touch with others like her who have not been followed up, either. Lisa says: 'It's unfair. I brought another child into the world after my operation, thinking that I would be fine. 'No one can tell me what the future holds, but I know this - if you have a neuroendocrine cancer, make sure you get followed up. 'It might be a slow growing, easy-to-treat cancer for most people - but not for all.'

'In big games like this, everyone has their moments, but we didn't take ours. We missed some clear chances,' Butragueno said. 'We had some very clear chances, particularly Bale's following a corner. We lacked that little bit of luck to get the second. 'If we had scored, I think we'd have given much more.

Butragueno, a striker who won La Liga six times at the Santiago Bernabeu during his playing career from 1984-1995, believes Madrid have the calibre of squad to overturn the four-point deficit that separates Madrid and Barcelona after the result. But tellingly, he did not list Bale in the players he believes will be key to any upturn from Carlo Ancelotti's team. 'There are 10 games to go. We must continue getting our injured players back,' Butragueno explained. '(Luka) Modric had a great game, giving us security in midfield, while James (Rodriguez) will soon be back with us.

A high-ranking officer in the Royal Navy 'deceitfully' forged the signature of a Lieutenant Commander who accused him of harassment and bullying to 'protect himself from future complaints', a court martial heard today. Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, of Yeovilton in Somerset, is accused of forging the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill on documents to bring an end to the 'never-ending' list of complaints against him. He is accused of using a scanner and a computer to help forge Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. The court heard the forged documents were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department that he had given clear management advice to his junior. They also heard the pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were both working on-board HMS Illustrious in July 2007, when it was based in New York. Captain Tritschler thought Lt Cdr Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard. Meanwhile, Lt Cdr Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'. Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy. Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler, who was then a Commander. Captain Tritschler denies three counts of forgery. David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'The accused, Captain Tritschler, is a man of previous impeccable character. 'In 2007 and 2008 he was the head of air engineering on HMS Illustrious. In July 2007 the complainant, Lieutenant Commander Bovill, was transferred to HMS Illustrious, which was the first ship he had served on. 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship. 'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying. 'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service. The pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were working on HMS Illustrious (pictured) in 2007 . 'In February 2008 Lt Cdr Bovill submitted a complaint and a decision was reached but Lt Cdr Bovill was not happy and asked for it to be taken to the next level.' The court then heard Captain Tritschler allegedly forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill and the documents bear signatures of both men. 'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner. 'There is no dispute that these signatures are forged. The dispute is whether Captain Tritschler is responsible for them. 'The prosecution's case is that Captain Tritschler only ever had the documents and the idea that someone else infiltrated them is fanciful. 'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does. The court heard how when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'. Mr Richards said: 'Lt Cdr Bovill made mistakes, however he felt these were dealt with in an unacceptable way by his superior, the accused, who he accused of humiliating and undermining him.' 'On February 21, 2008, Lt Cdr Bovill submitted his first complaint of bullying (regarding Tritschler's behaviour).' When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, Lt Cdr Bovill reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed. In interview, Cpt Tritschler denied forging the signatures and said he remembered Lt Cdr Bovill signing them in his presence. Mr Richards said: 'He insisted the documents were signed in front of him. 'The prosecution's case is that it was Captain Tritschler who generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.' Lt Cdr Bovill today told the board: 'Our relationship significantly deteriorated. I know that I made mistakes in how I went about my professional business. 'But I wanted to submit a complaint about the behaviour I was receiving. I thought he had a very abrupt and blunt manner with me.' Captain Tritschler denies three charges of forgery and the trial continues.

But just a few months ago, she was on the front lines fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. \"I think anybody that has any feelings for the countries in West Africa that were hit was feeling helpless,\" Meyler said. Meyler had spent the last nine years of her life in Liberia setting up the More Than Me Academy, a tuition-free school for at-risk Liberian girls. While she was on summer break last year, visiting her family in the United States, her mind kept going back to Liberia and the Ebola outbreak. She couldn't sit idle as her neighbors, friends and students were fighting for their lives. Meyler, who is not a medical professional, flew back to the front lines of a global epidemic, the last place most Americans wanted to be during the outbreak. Back in Liberia, Meyler quickly realized that fighting Ebola would be more complicated than administering medical care. With dozens of aid organizations descending on the country, few of them had a history or relationship with it. Meyler saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of West Point, the slum in which her school is located. Her ability to speak the Liberian-English dialect facilitated logistics. \"The people knew what was needed,\" Meyler said. \"They knew what to do. They just didn't have the resources.\" Her organization met with community leaders and they decided more ambulances were needed. In some instances, it took up to four days for an ambulance to show up. Meyler was able to bring in four ambulances and coordinate with the fathers of her students, who responded to calls by driving the ambulances. Meyler and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs, said Meyler. Next, they formed a group of active case finders, people who would go door to door in the poorest parts of West Point, looking for anyone that had fallen ill. Once a sick person was identified, a nursing team was dispatched to determine the next steps and treatment. The hardest part for Meyler, who often describes herself as a \"big kid,\" was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by Ebola. According to UNICEF, 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Meyler's school turned one of its guesthouses into Hope 21, a place to quarantine children suspected of having the Ebola virus. During the good times and the bad, Meyler took to Instagram to post photos and her thoughts. For nearly 100,000 of her followers, her Instagram became a window into the battle against Ebola. Social media have played a major role in the success of Meyler's organization since its inception nine years ago. To launch More Than Me, she did everything from fund-raising on MySpace to participating in clinical research studies. In 2012, the group was awarded a $1 million grant from JPMorgan Chase's American Giving Awards, after Facebook users voted for the organization. Long before Meyler became an Ebola fighter, she grew up in a working-class family from New Jersey. She always felt underprivileged, until she became involved in community service. That's when she decided to dedicate her life to helping people. Meyler has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in Liberia. She was one of the Ebola fighters honored as Time's Person of the Year in 2014. \"I'm not the same person that I was before Ebola hit,\" said Meyler. Reflecting on the months she spent fighting Ebola, she said, \"The people on the front lines that were risking their lives were the people who were fighting for their own lives, who were fighting for their children's lives.\" Now it is about learning to live with Ebola, said Meyler, whose school has dozens of students who are Ebola orphans and survivors.

A pair of Beatles super-fans are proving love is all you need having got married despite a 22-year age gap. Luke Owens, 27, and Anne, 50, met in 2010 at the secure unit where they both work as mental health nurses. Four years later, the couple married in a Beatles-themed ceremony and are preparing to jet off on their honeymoon to a Beatles festival in Kentucky, Louisiana, in May. Anne says that for her it had been love at first sight. 'I'd worked at the hospital for 20 years when I first met Luke, and I knew he was the one as soon as I met him,' she said. 'He'd just started at the medical centre, and when I first saw him I thought he was dead cute. 'I initially thought he was about 30, but he actually turned out to be 22 - I was 44.' Anne said she is often mistaken as much younger than her years, whereas Luke looks older for his age. And so despite a 22-year age gap, Anne decided to pursue Luke. She said: 'I wasn't sure whether he was interested or not at the start because he seemed a little shy, but I always used to make a beeline for him. 'I used to go out of my way to get shifts swapped with friends so that we could work together. 'One day, I hinted at a little date and gave him my number. We started texting and it went from friends to flirty, and then one night I decided to just give him a kiss and see what happened.' Luke says that he was glad that Anne had made the first move as he would never have had the confidence to. 'It was Anne that asked me out. I wouldn't have done it myself because of the age gap,' he said. 'I knew she was a bit older than me, but I was a bit worried at the start because I didn't know how old she was - you get told not to ask women her age so I waited a couple of months to find out.'

Although the pair suffered a little backlash at the beginning of their relationship Luke eventually received kudos for pulling an older woman. 'People laughed a bit at the start, but most people thought it must be good to be with an older woman,' he said. 'I got a few high fives off my mates - I think it earned me a few brownie points.' Anne said that although Luke was 'slow on the uptake' age gap relationships have benefits. 'Luke is quite romantic for his age. He's caring, thoughtful and funny. He doesn't take life too seriously, which is just so much more fun and makes me feel younger. Luke, 27 had been too scared to ask Anne, 50, out and so she made the first move after Luke began working in the same hospital and five years later they were married . 'Fifty year-old men seem so serious, but Luke's happy and carefree,' she said. 'He doesn't take life too seriously which is so much more fun. It rubs off on me and makes me feel younger.' Despite the pair sharing a love for the Beatles, Luke is the most dedicated fan of the two, and even organised a Beatles themed wedding.

Edin Dzeko believes English players are left exhausted by hard fought games in the Premier League . The Bosnia international couldn't find the net in City's shock 1-0 defeat by Burnley on Saturday . 'In all the other leagues, there is too big a gap between the top teams and the others - there are one, two, maybe three teams fighting for the title,' he told Goal.com. 'In England there are six or seven teams that can become champions and, as well, teams from the bottom can beat the top teams. 'That is one of the reasons why English teams sometime fail in Europe. With the Premier League as the strongest league in the world, every match is hard. Luis Suarez returned to England to score both goals in Barcelona's 2-1 defeat of Manchester City . City's Champions League hopes would be practically over had Joe Hart not saved Lionel Messi's late penalty . 'You cannot rest players, you always have to play full strength, while opponents in Europe can sometime rest some players in their domestic leagues. 'The first leg against Barcelona was very important,' the forward added. 'We tried not to lose at home but we were not good, especially in the first half. In the second half, we played better, scored, had a few chances to score more and who knows what would have happened if we didn't receive the red card? 'Now we want to surprise Barcelona. It will be tight until the end; we want to play much better than in the first leg and we will see if it will be enough to progress.'

Now, forty years after it was first launched, the Holden Sandman is back. Holden will unveil its new model 'freedom machine' - complete with groovy, orange shag pile floor rug - at next weekend's Rip Curl Pro surfing competition at famous Bells Beach in Torquay, south-west of Melbourne. The special edition 2015 Holden Sandman comes with the same retro body stickers, Sandman sunshades, dashboard stitching and custom interiors that made it so popular in the 70s . The 2015 Sandman will be available as a sports wagon or ute, but not as a panel van like the original 1970s model .

An old favourite of Australian surfers, bohemians and young lovers and bad boys, the new special edition Sandman comes with the same retro colour stickers, Sandman sunshades, dashboard stitching and custom interiors that made it such a legend back in the day. But it won't be available as a panel van like it was in the 1970s. The 2015 model is based on the VF Commodore SV6 and the sporty SS-V, and comes as a ute or  sports wagon with\u00a0V8 super car technology. Holden is making just 250 of the new model which are expected to go on sale in June for between $42,950 and $52,950. The original sandman used to cost buyers  between $3500 and $5000.

'It's built for new horizons: powered to take you wherever you get the urge. You make your own frontiers with this baby,' the posters said. 'If you've got the call of the wild, we've got your answer!' Holden branded the car 'Son of the beach'; The panel van and ute were perfect for throwing in the surfboards and camping on the sand dunes. Custom additions like the shag pile  seat covers and floor rugs turned the vehicle into a 'personal pleasure machine' ideal for the drive-in movies. 'Suddenly your van becomes a personal pleasure machine ... and it won't turn into a pumpkin if you're not home by midnight.' 'Let the good times roll.' According to Mysandman.com.au, a website dedicated to the classic wagon, the Sandman was 'a warning to parents everywhere that your daughters were no longer safe going to the drive-ins.'

Peter Keley, Holden\u2019s  Director of Sales,  says the opportunity to bring back the Sandman was irresistible. 'The Holden Sandman has been synonymous with the great Australian surf safari for decades and perfectly reflects our country\u2019s laid back, yet adventurous attitude to life. When the opportunity came to revive Sandman, we jumped at it,' Mr Keley said. 'The reborn Sandman is a statement and reflection of the Australian way of life. Most importantly, it\u2019s about having fun.' Kate Burling, a long-time fan of the Holden wagon, says she can't wait to see the new model. 'My  first love at 17 was my\u00a0Holden Kingswood, then it was the pano,' Ms Burling told Daily Mail Australia. 'I\u00a0never owned a Sandman but I just love it, it's such a classic car for the ultimate  aussie road trip, I can't wait to see what the new one looks like.'

But the ute was discontinued in 2006 due to slow sales. The 2015 Sandman launches on the heels of other recently revived Holden classics like the Collingwood Dore and Craig Lowndes, as the company tries to boost Commodore sales before it ends local production in 2017.

The abandoned site in north Wales, known as Denbigh Asylum, has been partially devastated by fire while there are still cages intact that were used to prevent patients escaping from their designated areas. More than 20 patients were selected for prefrontal lobotomy treatments between 1942 and 1944 at the hospital, with one patient dying from the controversial procedure. Lobotomies, which consisted of the removal of parts of the brain, began to be routinely carried out in the 1930s as a supposed treatment for those considered insane - but the barbaric practice was stopped two decades later with the introduction of antipsychotic medicines. The once eloquent and imposing building was built in 1848 and designed by architect Thomas Full James. It was designated for closure by MP Enoch Powell in 1960 and was finally shut for good in 1995. Photographer Mathew Growcoot described the scene: 'It was by far the creepiest place I have ever been into. There were so many strange noises emanating from the buildings that I really didn't want to wander too far from my companion. 'At one point we both heard what sounded like a groan and just stopped and stared at each other. I don't believe in ghosts but I didn't want to hang around.' The site has been subject to a compulsory purchase order by Denbighshire council. But that is being appealed by the site's current owners. The front facade is Grade II listed and a proposal to build homes around the entrance has been put forward. However, the restoration cost is set to be close to a million pounds. Mr Growcoot added: 'It was in a really poor state. It looked as thought a bomb had tore through the site, everything was damaged. There was nothing to stop you entering the site and as a result the vandalism and fire damage was plain to see. 'I wonder how far a million pounds would go to restoring the hospital.

Dana Lavette Cody, who married reality star George in an intimate ceremony in Malibu last year - which his daughter Aviva chose not to attend - explained to Daily Mail Online that, before meeting George, she was close to giving up on the idea of finding a soul mate who would live up to her standards. 'Before George, I only ever dated men my age or younger and I\u2019d never had an orgasm,\u2019 Dana, who is from Miami, says. Scroll down for video . Beach babes: Dana Lavette Cody, 26, married George Teichner, 79, in Malibu last year - and insists the couple are happier than ever, despite the 53-year age gap . Ageless love: Dana and George, pictured on their wedding day, met when George paid a visit to his wife's salon for a pedicure . \u2018I began to think sex was overrated. But then I met a man 53 years older than me and finally I see what all the fuss is about. \u2018My husband has the stamina of a 20-year-old. George thinks nothing of making love to me for at least five hours every night and he wears me out!\u2019 The couple's unconventional romance began in March 2011, when George, who appeared on a number of episodes of Real Housewives before his daughter Aviva was fired from the reality series last year, walked into Dana's Miami salon for a pedicure. Thanks to his healthy tan, the manicurist admits that she thought the infamous playboy - who became renowned among Real Housewives viewers and castmembers alike for his 'sickening', 'inappropriate' and 'disgusting' behavior towards women - was as young as 60 years old. And when George asked her for an email address following his appointment, Dana insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship. But two months later, he surprised her by asking her out on a date. \u2018I won\u2019t lie, at first it never even crossed my mind to see George as anything other than a successful businessman who could help me grow my business,' she says. 'But I couldn't see the harm in in saying yes.\u2019 The pair shared a romantic candlelit meal and Dana began to feel a mutual attraction. \u2018The more time I spent with George, the more I began to fancy him,' she recalls. Happy couple: The pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in Malibu, which George's daughter, former Real Housewives of New York star Aviva\u00a0Drescher, chose not to attend . Moving on: George's first wife, Aviva's mother, passed away a number of years ago . \u2018I loved how intelligent, successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference didn\u2019t seem to matter so much.\u2019 And while George's over-the-top sexual antics were the source of much horror among Aviva's Real Housewives co-stars, it seems to have worked wonders with Dana. About a month into their relationship the pair slept together for the first time, and Dana revealed that any concerns she had about their severe age gap quickly disappeared after the pair spent their first night together. \u2018Until I met George I had never ever experienced an orgasm,' she admits. \u2018But the first time we slept together, all that changed. I was so nervous. \u2018I thought he might have a wrinkly body and need Viagra. But George\u2019s physique is unbelievable as he works out every day \u2013 and Viagra was the last thing he needed. \u2018He\u2019d studied Tantric sex in India and I lost count of the number of times we had sex, but we were still at it when the sun came up. \u2018He was so skilled, he blew my mind. I lost count of how many orgasms I had.' Ironically, while George's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife, his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the Real Housewives - and their viewers. Indeed, castmember Carole Radziwill once went as far as to say of the aging Lothario and his 'uncomfortable' behavior: 'The problem is he's so over the top, it's uncomfortable to watch. 'I love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but I'm with the audience on this one: get George off the TV. Playboy: During his appearances on his daughter's reality show, George formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior . Sun-filled fun: George and Dana insist that their age gap does not bother them . 'It's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways.' But despite his less-than-chivalrous behavior during his appearance on Real Housewives, it didn't take much for George to win Dana over - and the couple's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength, despite the then-23-year-old not even knowing his real age. Despite knowing George was a widower with three daughters and two sons, all older than her, Dana admits that she didn't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating. \u2018By then I was so in love, I didn't care,' she admits. 'But on his birthday, I said to him, \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d \u2018He took a big drink of wine and took my car keys from me in case I ran away. Then he said: \u201cI\u2019m 77.\u201d I was shocked. \u2018So many things ran through my mind, about the prospect of having children with someone so much older, or the possibility of him dying years before me. \u2018But I couldn't let age stand in the way of true happiness with my soul mate.\u2019 In August 2013, George proposed during a family dinner at his daughter\u2019s house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in Malibu a year later. And while George's daughter Aviva, who was often forced to defend her father's shocking behaviour to her castmates, did not choose to attend the couple's wedding, Dana insists that the 44-year-old gave them 'full blessing' before they walked down the aisle. \u2018George\u2019s kids gave us their full blessing,' she explains. Family ties: Although Aviva (R) chose not to attend her father's wedding to Dana, the couple insist that the 44-year-old gave them her blessing . Motherhood: Aviva and her husband Reid Drescher (L) have two children together (pictured) 'After losing their mum, they are glad to see him so happy again. It was so romantic and afterwards we flew to Hawaii on honeymoon.\u2019 But not everyone has been so thrilled for the couple. Dana admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a \u2018prostitute\u2019 in marrying George, who is reported to be worth about $50 million. \u2018To this day, people point and snigger if they see us holding hands or kissing,' Dana admits. 'It did upset me, but I've grown a thicker skin and refuse to let some people\u2019s small mindedness ruin our happiness. \u2018George is not my sugar daddy. I am a successful woman in my own right. 'I didn't need looking after by a rich man before and I don\u2019t now either. I married him for love.

Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"", "label": 0.3250000085681677, "predicted": 0.46407264471054077}, "219": {"text": "(CNN)A convoy of U.S. Army armored vehicles is drawing crowds, cheers and tears as it makes an 1,100-mile journey from the Baltics through Poland and the Czech Republic to Germany.

One of the UK's most senior prosecutors dramatically resigned yesterday despite being cleared of improper conduct. Nazir Afzal, who led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in North West England, was accused of sending a text message to a defendant. An internal inquiry exonerated the highly experienced lawyer, who was honoured by The Queen in 2005, of any wrongdoing. But he nevertheless handed in his resignation as more senior colleagues insisted his departure is due to an 'on-going drive for efficiency'. The resignation is a direct blow to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders who has faced criticism for pursing campaign agendas instead of serving the general public. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. Mr Afzal took up his post in 2011 and led a huge team of about 700 lawyers, legal staff, and administrators. He was responsible for all criminal prosecutions across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and Cumbria. Earlier this week his staff received an email earlier this week saying it had always been his intention to step down in 2015. Mr Afzal led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache (left), who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell (right), who was also acquitted of child sex abuse .

He began his CPS career in central London and has prosecuted and advised on many high profile cases. Mr Afzal was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community. A CPS spokesman said: 'We are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and Nazir Afzal is leaving the Service as part of this ongoing drive for efficiency.

Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, captured photos of 'ultra-small bacteria' (pictured) Scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell .

Close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell. More than 150,000 Escherichia cells could fit onto the tip of a single human hair. The bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common. In their abstract, the scientists wrote: 'Ultrastructural features potentially related to cell and genome size minimization include tightly packed spirals inferred to be DNA, few densely packed ribosomes and a variety of pili-like structures that might enable inter-organism interactions that compensate for biosynthetic capacities inferred to be missing from genomic data.

In Japan, she visited Buddhist and Shinto shrines, and in Cambodia she traveled to Siem Reap, home to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex. At a high school outside of Siem Reap, Mrs Obama greeted students with a traditional Cambodian gesture of hands pressed together with a head bow. Only 20 percent of Cambodian children finish secondary school, but the rates are even lower for young women . Mrs Obama spoke to the girls about the importance of education as part of the Let Girls Learn program, which targets gender equality in developing countries .

Barack Obama became the first US president to visit Cambodia in 2012, and pressed Prime Minister Hun Sen in private on a variety of human rights and political issues during a meeting that White House officials described as tense. Hun Sen is one of the world's longest-serving heads of state, and has been regularly criticized by political opponents and human rights groups for monopolizing power and brutally crushing dissent. His supporters say he has helped stabilize the country, which is still haunted by a 1970s genocide that saw nearly 2 million people die under the ultra-communist Khmer Rouge regime. During its brutal reign, the Khmer Rouge closed schools and executed intellectuals among its many victims. Foreign aid and investment have helped the economy grow rapidly in the past decade, but the education system and overall development remain stunted. Even today, most Cambodian children drop out of school. According to 2014 statistics from the Education Ministry, 95 percent of children enter primary school, but only 20 percent finish secondary school. Mrs Obama also took a tour of Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap and took a picture with the pool that reflects the monument . The Angkor Wat temple complex was first built in the 12th century by the Khmer empire and has functioned as both a Hindu and Buddhist house of worship . Mrs Obama wore trainers to walk around on the dusty paths of the temple while accompanied by her guide . Poverty is the main problem, especially in rural areas, where families can't afford the minimal costs of education and keep children home to help support the family, according to UNICEF. Cambodia's problems with child prostitution, child labor and human trafficking also play a role, and often target girls. After meeting students Saturday, Mrs Obama spoke to a group of US Peace Corps volunteers who will be running the global project and called on them to share American values with their students. 'Values like equality, inclusiveness, fairness, openness ... aren't just American values, we know this. They are universal human values,' she said.

It\u2019s available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family. Prices range from \u00a399 ($152) for the basic model to \u00a3199 (\u00a3305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat. Mr Brito, 40, said: \u2018The idea of Leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it\u2019s disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather. \u2018We started thinking that there had to be an efficient, versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling.\u2019 It has taken him years to design and test the product, which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions.

Last summer, a firm in Delft, the Netherlands, invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella. The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph), because wind is directed over and around it. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. The clamp costs \u20ac39 (\u00a331) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for \u20ac25 (\u00a320) and \u20ac50 (\u00a340).", "label": 0.446428582072258, "predicted": 0.660275399684906}, "226": {"text": "Vincent Kompany and his Manchester City team-mates were out training on Tuesday as the club captain ramped up his attempt to reclaim his place in the side.

Hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the A&E crisis. Doctors say the controversial practice of \u2018boarding\u2019 \u2013 which amounts to letting wards overflow \u2013 is already being used at a number of under-pressure hospitals in England. It involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in A&E. Rather than criticising the measure, desperate A&E doctors say boarding should be used more widely \u2013 even though they concede it is \u2018potentially toxic\u2019. They argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units. As a result, doctors at the influential Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) have now given boarding their backing. But critics question its safety, amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing NHS wards. Dr Adrian Boyle, an A&E consultant at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge and a prominent RCEM member, argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys, after they had been seen and assessed, than languishing outside A&E in queuing ambulances. Between mid-December and mid-January, there were 11,203 occasions across England \u2013 more than 350 a day \u2013 in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A&Es were full. Casualties are often crammed because patients cannot be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds \u2013 a situation called \u2018exit block\u2019. Studies show that when A&Es are crowded, patients fare worse and death rates can rise. Dr Boyle said: \u2018Boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital, rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department.\u2019 He admitted it was \u2018potentially toxic and divisive\u2019 but said an \u2018exceptional response\u2019 was needed to \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. Dr Boyle said that \u2018a handful\u2019 of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods, but he would not name them. A spokesman for Addenbrooke\u2019s said they did not use the practice. Dr Boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the RCEM, which is advocating greater use of boarding. With hospitals \u2013 and A&Es in particular \u2013 getting busier every year, he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients. \u2018If we get a trend like this going on into next winter, it\u2019s going to be like Armageddon,\u2019 he warned. On 11,203 occasions across England \u2013 more than 350 a day \u2013 ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A&Es were full . Emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing. Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant at St Thomas\u2019s Hospital in London, said: \u2018It is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department, out of sight of the rest of the hospital.\u2019 But many medics have serious reservations. Dr Chris Whale, clinical director of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said there was \u2018pretty much no evidence\u2019 that boarding was safe in NHS hospitals. He said: \u2018For a Royal college to advocate this is fairly hazardous, without the evidence base to support it.\u2019 The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning for almost three years to stop the closure of A&E units.", "label": 0.48611112497746944, "predicted": 0.5610467791557312}, "230": {"text": "By Tuesday evening, Conor McGregor will have travelled more than 13,000 miles in 10 days and visited eight countries on three continents.

Under the lights at the Adelaide Oval a drop by Rahat Ali proved to be the turning point as Australia chased down the below-par 213 set by Pakistan. The recalled Josh Hazlewood took 4-35 to restrict the 1992 World Cup winners to such a low total before Shane Watson hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie. Mitchell Starc celebrates a wicket with his team-mates as Australia ripped through Pakistan's batting line-up . Sohail Khan successfully appeals for the wicket of Aaron Finch, as Pakistan fought back with the ball . Sohail Khan puts down a catch in the outfield, as Pakistan failed to take their chances and apply the pressure . Aggressive, brave, attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the World Cup so far. Brendon McCullum, AB de Villiers and today Michael Clarke are proving that despite the wickets by-and-large being a paradise for batsmen, their ingenuity can and does lead to success. Yet Misbah brings his own unique style of captaincy to the table with a calm demeanour, even in the face of collapse and struggle, that breeds belief within his side and almost earned them a shock win. Pakistan came into the match in a confident mood, on the back of four successive victories, following heavy defeats in the first two matches of the World Cup group stage. Batting first, after winning the toss, seemed the sub-continental side\u2019s best chance of defeating Australia. Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s centurion in their previous match against Ireland, couldn\u2019t replicate his heroics as he edged Mitchell Starc to a diving Watson at slip for 10. And Hazlewood, brought back at the expense of Pat Cummins, justified his selection as he sent down a wide ball that moved away from Ahmed Shehzad and was edged to Clarke at second slip. Wahab Riaz cannot hide his disappointment as, despite a strong spell, Pakistan came up short . Shane Watson (left) and Steve Smith (right) steadied the ship as Australia eventually made it home safely . With both of Pakistan\u2019s openers back in shed, the indomitable Misbah strode to the crease, in what was to be his final one-day international match. The circumstances, with Pakistan 24-2 in the sixth over, were nothing new to Pakistani captain who has long been called upon to be the saviour of the side \u2013 not least in this World Cup. But every great sporting saviour needs a bit of luck from time to time and Misbah\u2019s came just two balls into his innings. Hazlewood steamed in, saw the ball clip the 40-year-old\u2019s thigh pad and hit leg stump, the bails lit-up but then stayed in place. It was a lifeline both Misbah and his side desperately needed and along with Haris Sohail, Pakistan\u2019s innings began to be rebuilt. The pair shared a 73-run third wicket partnership and just when they looked ready to propel their side to a competitive total, greed became the undoing of their usually risk-free leader Misbah. Misbah-ul-Haq top scored for Pakistan with 34, as they lost wickets at regular intervals against Australia . Umar Akmal works the ball away behind square on the offside, as plenty of Pakistan batsmen got in and out . Mitchell Starc dives to take a catch which ends the Pakistan innings in the final over of their 50 . Equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from Australian captain Clarke, who brought Glenn Maxwell back despite Misbah having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack. But, it was Maxwell who had the last laugh as the right-handed batsman eyed the shortest boundary once more but instead holed-out to Aaron Finch in the deep for 34. It was a sad end for one of Pakistan\u2019s greatest players, who passed 3,000 ODI runs as captain during his innings. A typical Johnson short ball got rid of the set Haris (41) before Maxwell claimed his second scalp of the innings as Umar Akmal (20) was dismissed in an identical fashion to his captain. So at 124-5 Shahid \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 Afridi, the only batsman to have hit more sixes than fours in ODI\u2019s, was required to clear the ropes a few times. Though he did that, smashing three four\u2019s and one six in his innings, he needed to make far more than the 23 of 15 balls that he amassed. Pakistan bowled well early on, but didn't take their chances as Australia began to exert control . Australia\u2019s fast bowlers; Hazlewood and Starc (2-40) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213, they were the side on top going into the break. The statistics really best summed up Pakistan\u2019s batting performance; eight batsmen made double figures, none of them passed 50, all 10 were out caught. Pace bowlers have dominated the World Cup thus far and with both sides boasting some of the best in business it was of little surprise that Australia faltered in their chase of their modest target. Sohail Khan trapped Finch plumb in front for just two and although Finch reviewed the decision, there was no changing how straight the delivery was. What followed, from the eighth over onwards was a masterclass in brutal but glorious fast bowling from Wahab Riaz. The 29-year-old\u2019s first over accounted for the dangerous David Warner for 24 as he sent a short and wide delivery down third man\u2019s throat. Wahab\u2019s second got rid of Clarke (8) as another well-directed short ball was gleefully taken by Sohaib Maqsood at forward short leg. The left-handed bowler continued to steam in and had Shane Watson scampering around as if he was holding a bat for the first time. Steve Smith hit an excellent half century to set Australia back on the path to victory at the Adelaide Oval . And for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to Wahab\u2019s name but for a spectacularly poor drop by Rahat Ali at fine leg as Watson sent the ball to him. Meanwhile at the other end Steve Smith, easily Australia\u2019s best batsman for the past 12 months, was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings. But having made 65, the 25-year-old seemed to momentarily lose concentration and fell lbw to a fuller Ehsan Adil delivery. The task of seeing Australia home then fell on Watson's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings, he shared an unbeaten 68-run partnership with Maxwell (44 not out) as Australia reached their target with 16 overs to spare. Undeniably Wahab produced one the greatest World Cup bowling spells and deserved so much more then to be on the losing side. Australia may have outplayed India, their semi-final opponents, during the tri-series prior to the World Cup but the match on Thursday will be very different. The 2011 World Cup champions have considerably raised their game and Australia will face their sternest test yet in Sydney as they chase a fifth World Cup title.", "label": 0.0625, "predicted": 0.4292007386684418}, "233": {"text": "Guests at a wedding service saw triple when three identical sisters tied the knot together at the same ceremony.

Even the grooms - Rafael, Gabriel and Eduardo - admitted they had worried they might mix up their wives-to-be when it came to exchanging vows. Rafael, who married Rafaela, told how the girls sometimes deliberately confused their fiances. He remembered: 'There was a time when we were all in the kitchen making dinner. So Rochele, who is Gabriel's, was doing stuff at the sink, and Rafaela was at the stove. 'We were there chatting and they changed places. I went behind to hug her, and said \"oops\" when I realised I'd got the wrong girl.' On the day, though, the men insisted they didn't have a problem recognising the loves of their lives. 'Oh yes, I knew which one was mine, for sure. I knew as soon as she entered the church, she was the most beautiful,' said Eduardo, who married Tagiane. The sisters told how, like other identical siblings, they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies. Bond: Like many identical siblings, the sisters told how they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies . Together:\u00a0It was parents Pedro and Salete who suggested the girls all get married together after Tagiane also got engaged to Eduardo . Their parents, Pedro and Salete, already had one daughter, Liziele, when they decided to increase the family - but never imagined three more girls would come at once. Mother Salete fainted when she was told she was expecting triplets, according to the girls. Rafaela was the first to find her future husband, Rafael, ten years ago while studying at university. A year later, Rochele got together with Gabriel. It was parents Pedro and Salete who suggested the girls all get married together after Tagiane also got engaged to Eduardo. The only dilemma for Pedro, a farmer, was how he would walk all three daughters down the aisle at once. He said: 'We decided that we would all walk down the aisle until half way down the church. From there, I would take one at a time.' The pews at the Nossa Senhora Aparecida catholic cathedral in Passo Fundo were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together. They were followed by 18 bridesmaids and page boys, each using the chosen colour of the bride they were representing, yellow for Rafaela, blue for Rochele and red for Tagiane. The first to be taken to the altar by their father was Tagiane, who was the first to be born. She remembered: 'I tried to hold back my emotion, but I couldn't.

The Barcelona superstar made a habit of performing the skill during his side's 1-0 Champions League win, mesmerising both the 92,000 crowd and City players including Brazilian Fernandinho.

Milner is left on his backside as Messi runs away from the England international with the ball . What is a nutmeg? A nutmeg is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent's legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. Where does the word come from? The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy \u2014 a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: 'Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang 'nutmegs', meaning 'testicles'. In case Messi is ever interested.' However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic.

Other European/Latin and African countries - panna . Germany - tunnel, Beinschuss . France - petit pont . Finland -\u00a0langet . Ukraine - 25 kopiyok - meaning 25 cents player owes . South Africa - iShibobo . Holland - poorten, panna . Nigeria - O-C - meaning 'oh see' Egypt - kobry . Malaysia and Singapore - ole . Kenya - 'chobo, chobwe . Japan - Matanuki . Iran - lauyee .

Zambia - pomo . Portugal - cueca, rata . Zimbabwe - deya . Tunisia - adma . Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged. The verb nutmegged is listed by the Oxford English Dictionary as 'arising in the 1870s which in Victorian slang came to mean \"to be tricked or deceived, especially in a manner which makes the victim look foolish\".' In Spanish a nutmeg is known as 'cano' or 'tunel', while many countries around the world have their own unique words to describe the skill. Sportsmail's top 10 nutmegs . 10. John O'Shea on Luis Figo, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2003 . That isn't written the wrong way. Honest. Manchester United's utility man gave the Portuguese superstar a taste of his own medicine with this silky piece of skill in a Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford almost 12 years ago. 9. Fernando Redondo on Henning Berg, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2000 . Another Champions League clash between United and Real, another stunning nutmeg. Three years before O'Shea's effort Redondo set up the visitors' winning goal for Raul with a sublime flick through the legs of Berg. 8. Lionel Messi on James Milner, Barcelona vs Manchester City, 2015 . Messi's brilliant piece of skill - one of many on Wednesday night - is only good enough for eighth place on our countdown. The fact Milner came rushing in counts against the Argentine, although leaving the England international on his backside earns him extra points. 7.\u00a0Ronaldinho on Chievo, AC Milan vs Chievo, 2010 . Some Brazilian magic from Ronaldinho now, as he toys with a helpless Chievo player in Serie A. The former Barca man is renowned for his dribbling skills and they can be seen in full flow in the clip below, which includes an audacious backheel nutmeg. 6. Ryan Giggs on Jason Cundy, Tottenham vs Manchester United, 1992 . The first nutmeg on our countdown which ended with the architect scoring. Giggs pounces on a mistake by Dean Austin, pops the ball through Cundy's legs before rounding goalkeeper Ian Walker to score. Not bad for an 18-year-old. 5. Luis Suarez on Ryan Shotton, Stoke vs Liverpool, 2011 . Similar to Giggs' effort in that it ended with a goal, Suarez showed superb vision to knock the ball past Shotton and create some space for himself. His next touch wasn't bad either, bending his shot into the bottom corner of Thomas Sorensen's net to help Liverpool into the Carling Cup fifth round. 4. Lionel Messi on Emir Spahic, Sevilla vs Barcelona, 2012 . Wednesday night's game against City wasn't the first time Messi has caught the eye with a nutmeg. The little Argentine showed speed, composure and skill against Sevilla as he put the ball through Spahic's legs before delightfully chipping the ball into the back of the net. 3. Ricardo Kishna on Stefano Marzo, Ajax vs Heerenveen, 2014 . One of Ajax's bright young things, Kishna showed exactly why he's destined for a big future with this outrageous touch late last year. The 20-year-old's flicked nutmeg left Marzo stranded and Ajax on the attack. Perfection. 2. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Steven Davis, Northern Ireland vs Portugal, 2013 . A wonderful piece of skill from Ronaldo who first fools Davis with a Cruyff turn before popping the ball in between the Southampton man's legs. The Portuguese also gets a whack but the referee plays advantage as he retains possession with a neat backheel to a team-mate. 1. Juan Roman Riquelme on Mario Yepes, Boca Juniors vs River Plate, 2000 . One of the most talented players of his generation, Riquelme was no stranger to moments of magic on the pitch. Even in a heated Copa Libertadores quarter-final he was cool enough to beat Yepes with a brilliant rolled nutmeg. Class. PS .

Cole's experience was completely different to Liam Scholes from Sale High School in Manchester who also arrived in class dressed as Christian Grey from the novel. Teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book. Staff then rang Liam's mother Nicola, who herself is a primary school teacher, to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate. She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey. 'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea. 'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem. 'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.'

However, nothing could have prepared her for the emotions she experienced over her youngest child in the past few weeks. What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother. Scroll down for video . Jen Shaw (left) with her daughter Chasley (right) who had a dangerous reaction to taking two doses of Nurofen . What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering . Chasely was checked over by a GP on Monday February 25 and confirmed Ms Shaw's suspicions that her daughter was just suffering from a cold: 'a mild cough, a runny nose and a case of \u201cbaby grumpys\u201d but otherwise fine.' Ms Shaw, a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing, gave Chasely two doses of Nurofen on Tuesday February 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week. This was the first time that the seven-month-old had ever taken any medication before but Ms Shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken Nurofen in the past. 'She seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief.' Ms Shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects. 'I remember scouring the Nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction, but couldn't find much at all,' she said. 'If I can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut.' The nasty blister on her ear (left) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body (right) The seven-month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst . Casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller Endone to ease her excruciating pain . After a very restless night with her unhappy little one - Ms Shaw knew they had to go to the hospital. 'She was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain, fists clenched, balling over and clamping down every time I would try to feed her,' 'By the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes, nose and mouth, her neck also was red and had what I thought was bad nappy rash.' After several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection. But the next morning, Chasely had several nasty blisters on her face and neck, and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping, her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill. They went back to the hospital, where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor Chasely. 'The day in emergency was quite scary, I remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry, but more than anything seeing confusion,' she said. 'A kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl.' 'I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on,'\u00a0Ms Shaw said to her sick little girl . Finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called\u00a0Steven Johnson\u2019s syndrome -\u00a0a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction. 'Doctors came from all around that afternoon to see Chasely and her skin, it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before,' she said. 'I mean how could they fix her if they didn't even know what it was?' Chasely was treated with a high dose antibiotics and Panadol for her excruciating pain. 'Through Thursday night she was checked almost hourly, her entire skin was red and hot, she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain. 'She wouldn't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her.' When Ms Shaw woke on Friday morning, she said she couldn't even recognise her own baby. 'A doctor told me to prepare for the worst, that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile. 'My heart completely shattered - I thought we would lose her.' It was at this point that Ms Shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her  beautiful little girl. 'Once I got baby Chasely to sleep, I escaped to the bathroom and sobbed,' she said. 'I didn't know how to fix this, what do I do next? I could only give myself over to the hospital, and to a higher power.' But Ms Shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight. 'I returned and I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on, just fight this off and we will go home. I gave her all my energy and all my love,' she said. Ms Shaw cried when she saw Chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing . By Monday Chasely's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself . Numbing gel was used in Chasely's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw. The pain was so bad that she had to be given Endone which Ms Shaw said was extremely frightening as it's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice. Finally, by Saturday afternoon, Chasely started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around. 'My sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys, and though she couldn't smile and laugh I could see she was amused,' she said. The following day, \u00a0her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and Ms Shaw began to recognise her little girl again. By Monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself. 'I cried when I saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing.' Chasely was released from hospital on Tuesday where her skin could be treated at home. Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl. 'We are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters.' Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl . She doesn't know how she could have gone on if Chasely didn't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state. 'I'm not sure I would have coped very well - I can't imagine going through what some parents have,' she said. Chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Ms Shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter's condition. But she insists she feels no animosity towards Nurofen. 'I'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - I just want to educate and empower people on what can happen,' she said. 'But there is a list of 300 different medications, antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey.'

A decade later, they have transformed from angelic-looking boys into strapping, handsome young men. Charlie is currently enjoying a year out from his advertising degree to complete internships and Gabriel, his gentle younger brother, is in his final year studying his A-levels. Scroll down for video . All grown up: Gloria Hunniford pictured with her grandsons Gabriel (far left) and Charlie (far right). The boys were just ten and seven when they lost their mum, Caron Keating, to breast cancer . As they were: Doting Gloria, pictured with her grandsons as young children, says she feels disappointment that her daughter isn't here to watch her sons' achievements . The days when she could cradle them in her arms have long passed but their achievements leave their grandmother, Gloria Hunniford, bursting with pride. However she admits her happiness hides traces of disappointment that their mother has missed sharing their milestones. The Loose Women panelist and TV presenter, 74, said: \u2018The only time I do get frustrated is when I think about all the brilliant moments Caron\u2019s missing as the boys grow up. 'When Charlie first went to university, I felt really quite disturbed by that. Caron had an understanding of English literature that I don\u2019t have. She would have loved to sit down with Charlie and now with Gabriel to discuss whatever it was that they were studying. \u2018From the research I\u2019ve done, it seems that a child misses a parent most when he graduates, when he gets engaged, when he marries and particularly when he has his first child. You want to show your child to your parents. And Charlie and Gabriel will never be able to do that with their mother.\u2019 What bolsters Miss Hunniford, who is married to hairdresser Stephen Way, is the warm and loving relationship she has with her grandsons. They tease her mercilessly, which she plainly adores, calling her a variety of names from Glo, to G-Dog, G-Lo or Big G. She said: \u2018What helps to sustain me now is that they\u2019ve turned out to be such fine young men. And I think it\u2019s lovely that they\u2019re still very huggy with me, very demonstrative which isn\u2019t always the case with boys of their age and they rib me all the time. \u2018They\u2019re part of my healing. I see Caron\u2019s spirit living on in them and that\u2019s a comfort to me. Charlie has her wicked sense of humour and Gabriel looks so like her. They\u2019ve been in my life from the moment they entered the world, quite literally. Caron asked me to be there as each of them was born. So the bond between us has always been exceptionally tight and was made even more so because of her loss.\u2019 Miss Keating was a popular Blue Peter presenter and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. She was initially told she would be lucky to survive more than 18 months but went on to live for seven years before she died in her mother\u2019s arms in 2004. Unbreakable bond: Gloria keeps the memory of Caron, who passed away in 2004, alive with regular fundraising events for the Caron Keating Foundation . Soon after, Miss Hunniford, backed by the rest of the family, set up the Caron Keating Foundation which has now raised millions, given away in small grants to hundreds of deserving causes for all types of cancer. At the end of November (2014), a glitzy dinner at the Dorchester was organised to celebrate Caron\u2019s life and to talk about the foundation. A succession of famous faces, both in person and on screen, paid their tributes. Ant and Dec, Cliff Richard, Janet Ellis, Rod Stewart, Michael Ball, Neil Diamond, Rob Brydon \u2013 all shared recollections of the popular TV presenter. The Blue Peter presenter lost her battle with breast cancer when her sons, Charlie and Gabriel, were just 10 and seven . Charlie joked: \u2018And I learnt a few things about Mum - I didn\u2019t know that Phillip Schofield could have been my dad. Apparently, he and Mum went out together for about a year which was something no one had ever told me.\u2019 There were insights for Gabriel, too, about his quirky dress sense: \u2018I didn\u2019t realise me and my mum shared the same shopping habits. She also tended to buy clothes that a normal person might not. 'For example, I got it into my head recently to buy a completely white puffa jacket which is totally impractical as I discovered today when a girl gave me a big hug and got foundation all down it. Glo tells me Mum was into grunge before it had been invented. She had a really wacky dress sense. And she was a hoarder like me.\u2019 Gloria on Caron's wedding day to the boys' father Russ Lindsay. He's since gone on to remarry, to television presenter Sally Meen, and have two daughters . Their father Russ Lindsay went on to marry breakfast presenter Sally Meen, 49, in 2006 and the boys have two half-sisters they adore: Tilly, six and Flora. Charlie and Gabriel are committed to running the foundation in the future but for now Miss Hunniford is more than happy to carry on, for keeping Caron\u2019s memory alive is a source of comfort: \u2018I have a little saying,\u2019 she said: \u2018People never die if they live on the lips of the living.\u2019 For more information, www.caronkeating.org .", "label": 0.31730769760906696, "predicted": 0.5774760246276855}, "242": {"text": "Free to go: Ghoncheh Ghavami, 26, from west London, will not have to return to prison in Iran . A law graduate from west London who was jailed after for trying to attend a men's volleyball game in the Iranian capital will not have to return to prison, her family has said. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 26, was arrested at a Tehran stadium as she tried to attend a volleyball match between Iran and Italy last June. Ghavami, who has dual British and Iranian nationality, was freed on bail in November and has today been told that the remainder of her sentence has been waived. The former law student, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, lodged an appeal against the charges earlier this month. Ms Ghavami spent 151 days in an Iranian prison after being found  guilty of 'propagating against the ruling system'.

When she was released on bail things were really difficult but they have improved over the last few months.

'The campaign had a tremendous effect from day one. Before it started we were all hopeless and we did not see any other option but to go public.

Edward Davenport, nicknamed \u2018Fast Eddie\u2019, was jailed for eight years in 2011 for masterminding a \u00a34.5million fraud where he hoodwinked the rich and famous. Last May he was released early after claiming he was 'at death's door' because of kidney problems and suffering the 'ordeal' of having to leave prison each week for life-saving dialysis. But eight months on socialite Davenport looks to be close to a full recovery as he had fun with a friend on Saturday. New life: Eight months after being released from prison on health grounds Edward 'Fast Eddie' Davenport is seen here kissing a friend on Saturday . He was seen kissing and hugging an unnamed woman as they walked through central London. As a property developer and party organiser he  made millions and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry. His \u00a330million home, a mansion in London\u2019s West End, was the former Sierra Leone High Commission and was used as a location for the Oscar-winning film The King\u2019s Speech. But the socialite was ruined when he was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes and jailed - only for his health to falter. Last year he was pictured handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant. He said at the time: \u2018I know I\u2019m fighting a death sentence. \u2018I feel like an old man shuffling around, chained to a prison officer even when I want to go to the bathroom. 'I can\u2019t even wear my own silk pyjamas \u2013 I have to wear the hospital ones. The truth is I feel shaky. I know I\u2019m at death\u2019s door'. Fall from grace: Davenport was one of London's richest and most popular socialites until he was convicted of a multi-million pound fraud and later required a second kidney transplant . Contrast: A grey-looking Davenport shortly before he was jailed for almost eight years in 2011 and, right, enjoying the sunshine in central London with a companion over the weekend . Judges agreed to his plea for clemency and cut his sentence by a year to allow him to be released early after serving around three years. Davenport's fall from grace is a far cry from his days at the heart of the London party scene in the 1980s. His black-tie Gatecrasher Balls, aimed at wealthy public school teenagers, quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery and helped him make his fortune. But it also led to his first fraud conviction and nine months in jail. Despite the setback, Davenport never lost his love of taking risks \u2013 even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble. In 1998, he and two other men were charged with running up an \u00a318,000 bill at the luxury Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland during a five-day New Year party while posing as aristocrats. They denied the claims and charges were later dropped. A year later, he bought the lease of the Sierra Leone High Commission building in Central London for just \u00a350,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war. The property is said to be worth \u00a330 million and was used to film scenes for the Oscar-winning movie The King\u2019s Speech. But in May 2011 Davenport was given eight years for his part in a \u00a34.5 million fraud. The judge described him as the \u2018ringmaster\u2019 who was careful not to leave \u2018footprints in the snow.\u2019 Recovery: A year ago the fraudster was getting treatment in hospital in south London where he had to be accompanied by prison officers an handcuffed to his chair . The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana\u2019s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport. After his latest conviction  a defective kidney failed and meant he needed repeated visits to hospital - where he was handcuffed to his bed while undergoing treatment. Last March his sentence was reduced to six years and eight months by judges at London\u2019s Criminal Appeal Court, who said that, although there was nothing wrong with his original punishment, it should be reduced as an act of mercy and meant he could be freed two months later.", "label": 0.4312500059604645, "predicted": 0.478889524936676}, "244": {"text": "As most kids were spending their school break heading off on vacation or sitting at home, Ashima Shiraishi was busy breaking some very longstanding world records.

It's back: Originally from North Africa, the oryx antelope is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in 1999 - due to hunting and loss of habitat . The horns are made from hollow bone, so can break off quite easily and do not grow back - making one horned oryx a relatively common occurrence. The oryx antelope, originally from North Africa, is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in 1999 - due to hunting and loss of habitat.

The Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was found in animals at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is just 35 miles north of New Orleans. The bacteria, primarily found in south-east Asia, can spread to animals and humans through direct contact with contaminated soil and water. A potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears (stock image) But despite thorough investigations by multiple authorities the cause of the release and extent of the contamination are still unknown. It is the latest in a series of significant accidents that have taken place across the country. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the release was worrying. Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a wide range of symptoms including fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Several countries have studied using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. If the disease is left untreated it is fatal. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. Confirmed infections are relatively rare. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he told USA Today. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' Research was being completed at the center using rodents to try and find a vaccine against the bacteria. But at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been accidentally exposed to it. The first was discovered nearly three months ago in November and two have since died. All four were in the center's veterinary hospital at the same time, leading to speculation that it could have been where the animals were exposed. At least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been exposed to the bacteria (stock image) But one US Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigator was also hospitalised after blood tests showed she had antibodies indicating a current or prior exposure to the bacteria. She is now recovering. Authorities are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Andrew Lackner, director of the center, said: 'We're taking this extraordinarily seriously. It's very disturbing to us.

The drug, currently known as ATX-101, now only needs to receive final FDA approval before it becomes available to the public. Unlike current double chin surgeries, which require doctors to 'cut it out or suck it out,' ATX-101 will be a 'noninvasive, in-the-office procedure,' according to Dr. Susan Weinkle. Scroll down for video . A dermatologist prepares the injection site for ATX-101, a new injectable drug  designed to eliminate double chins without surgery that was unanimously recommended for approval by an FDA advisory committee . ATX-101 works by eliminating the membrane of fat cells underneath the double chin. This causes the fat cell to burst, destroying it permanently. Side-effects include short-term swelling, bruising and numbness . Weinkle, a dermatologist who has been working with ATX-101 since 2007, said many people have fat underneath the chin, even if 'they're not fat in the rest of their body', she told ABC News. To insert the drug, Weinkle marks the area where she sees the 'max amount of fat' with a grid of tiny dots, which act as the injection sites for the ATX-101. Weinkle says the procedure only takes about five minutes and patients heal in two to three days - and don't even need to wear a bandage. The drug is a  formulation of deoxycholic acid, a 'naturally occurring molecule' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food, according to manufacturer KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals. Dr. Derek Jones, who presented ATX-101 to the FDA, said the drug destroys the membrane of the fat cells underneath the double chin. The ATX-101 treatment only takes five minutes to administer and two to three days to heal . This causes the fat cell to burst.\u00a0Its remains are naturally absorbed back into the body, while the cell is destroyed permanently. As with any drug, there are side effects. They include short-lasting swelling, bruising and numbness that was found to be 'mild to moderate', according to dermatologist Adam M. Rotunda. Fleeting pain at the site of the injections was also reported. Rotunda noted in the trials that the intensity of the side effects decreased with each additional treatment session, he told\u00a0Dermatology Times. Although the drug reaches its maximum desired effect if the patient undergoes six treatments spaced a month apart, Rotunda said he does not believe 'most patients' will require that many. Rotunda said ATX-101 could be a game-changer in terms of what dermatologists can do when patients are worried about their neck. 'We've been accustomed to addressing patient aesthetic concerns primarily from the chin up,' he told Dermatology Times. 'However, the neck...is critical in framing the lower half of the face and creating our profile. Changes in the neck as we age or gain weight can have profound effect on our self-esteem.' The drug is a formulation of deoxycholic acid, a 'naturally occurring molecule' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food, according to manufacturer KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals . Dr. Michael Edwards, president of the Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, said not everyone is a good candidate for the drug. He told NBC News\u00a0he worries that, after ATX-101 is approved, people will use the drug to try and fix larger areas of fat. But according to Weinkle, the drug is 'not a weight loss treatment' and needs to be administered properly so that patients get a 'very even reduction of fat.' She warns that physicians must 'understand the anatomy' of the area underneath the chin, which houses delicate nerves that should not be touched. Edward recommends patients only receive the procedure from trained 'board certified experts'. ATX-101 has been tested in 19 clinical studies with 2,600 patients.

The legal action comes after repeated requests filed under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act have gone unfulfilled. They include one request AP made five years ago and others pending since the summer of 2013. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, comes a day after Clinton broke her silence about her use of a private email account while secretary of state. The FOIA requests and lawsuit seek materials related to her public and private calendars, correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president, and Clinton-related emails about the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices. Scroll down for video . Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks to the reporters at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday about her private email system. The Associated Press filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the State Department to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from Clinton's tenure . 'After careful deliberation and exhausting our other options, The Associated Press is taking the necessary legal steps to gain access to these important documents, which will shed light on actions by the State Department and former Secretary Clinton, a presumptive 2016 presidential candidate, during some of the most significant issues of our time,' said Karen Kaiser, AP's general counsel. 'The press is a proxy for the people, and AP will continue its pursuit of vital information that's in the public interest through this action and future open records requests,' she said. State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach declined to comment.\u00a0He had previously cited the department's heavy annual load of FOIA requests \u2014 19,000 last year \u2014 in saying that the department 'does its best to meet its FOIA responsibilities.' He said the department takes requests 'first in, first out,' but noted that timing depends on 'the complexity of the request.' Michael Oreskes, a senior managing editor at AP, said the news agency was planning to file additional requests under FOIA following the disclosure last week that Clinton used a private email account run on a server on her property outside New York while working at the State Department. Clinton on Tuesday said she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state. She said roughly half were work-related, which she turned over to the State Department, while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature. The department says it will take several months to review the material Clinton turned over last year. Once the review is complete, the department said, the emails will be posted online. The AP had sought Clinton-related correspondence before her use of a personal email account was publicly known, although Wednesday's court filing alleges that the State Department is responsible for including emails from that account in any public records request. 'State's failure to ensure that Secretary Clinton's governmental emails were retained and preserved by the agency, and its failure timely to seek out and search those emails in response to AP's requests, indicate at the very least that State has not engaged in the diligent, good-faith search that FOIA requires,' says AP's legal filing. AP is seekin materials related to her public and private calendars, correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president, and Clinton-related emails about the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices . Clinton is pictured here later on Tuesday at the Step It Up For Gender Equality 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference On Women.\u00a0Clinton said earlier in the day that she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years at State, roughly half were work-related, which she turned over to the State Department, while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature . Specifically, AP is seeking copies of Clinton's full schedules and calendars from her four years as secretary of state; documents related to her department's decision to grant a special position to longtime aide Huma Abedin; related correspondence from longtime advisers Philippe Reines and Cheryl Mills, who, like Abedin, are likely to play central roles in a Clinton presidential campaign; documents related to Clinton's and the agency's roles in the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices; and documents related to her role overseeing a major Defense Department contractor. The AP made most of its requests in the summer of 2013, although one was filed in March 2010. AP is also seeking attorney's fees related to the lawsuit. Other organizations have also sued the State Department recently after lengthy delays responding to public record requests. In December, the conservative political advocacy group Citizens United sued the State Department for failing to disclose flight records showing who accompanied Clinton on overseas trips. Last week, the National Security Archive, an organization that gathers declassified government records, filed a lawsuit after waiting more than seven years for the State Department to release of details of former secretary of state Henry Kissinger's telephone conversations. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, predicted the State Department would speed up its review facing legal action, particularly given that Clinton has said that her email correspondence doesn't include classified material. 'When the government is under a court deadline, or really wants to review, they can whip through thousands of pages in a matter of weeks, which they should do here,' Blanton said. The State Department generally takes about 450 days to turn over records it considers to be part of complex requests under the Freedom of Information Act. That is seven times longer than the Justice Department and CIA, and 30 times longer than the Treasury Department.

The company agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case. Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington. Prosecutors said McNeil knew about the problem for nearly a year but failed to take immediate steps to fix it. Admission: McNeil Consumer Healthcare acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering adulterated bottles of Infants' and Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin which contained metal particles . The company and prosecutors said in court Tuesday that no one was injured. 'McNeil's failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices is seriously troubling,' Acting Assistant Attorney General Mizer said in a statement after the judge accepted McNeil's plea. 'The Department of Justice will continue to be aggressive in pursuing and punishing companies such as McNeil that disregard a process designed to assure quality medicines, especially OTC drugs for infants and children,' he said. McNeil is a unit of Johnson & Johnson. The New Brunswick, New Jersey, health care giant has struggled with scores of product recalls since 2009. In this case, McNeil first learned of the particle problem in May 2009, when a consumer complained about black specks inside a bottle of Infants' Tylenol, according to court documents. McNeil subsequently found metal particles during production but continued making the liquid medicines for several more months. Products: Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington . 'There were investigative steps taken, but not all of the steps required under all of our internal operating procedures,' company attorney Michael Schwartz told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

The 10-year-old boy was admitted to hospital in Bologna, Italy, after suffering a seizure. Hours later, doctors reported he suffered another three seizures. He also complained of a bad headache and had high blood pressure. He appeared to be suffering from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a condition characterized by headache, confusion, seizures and visual loss. A 10-year-old boy suffered four seizures which doctors found was due to his habit of eating 20 liquorice sweets a day for four months . But doctors were baffled as CT and MRI scans ruled out all the major condition that lead to PRES. During a medical examination a week later doctors noticed that the boy\u2019s teeth were black. It transpired that he had been eating at least 20 liquorice sweets each day for the past four months. This mean he was consuming of 2.88 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid, one of the active ingredients of liquorice. That volume is well above the World Health OrganiSation\u2019s recommended maximum of 2 mg/kg. This excessive consumption had resulted in his development of high blood pressure, and in turn PRES. After the boy stopped eating the sweets, his treatment was gradually reduced and his blood pressure returned to normal. In light of the case, doctors are now calling for a recommended daily amount to be printed clearly on sweets packets as a safety measures.

The risk of PRES risk is particularly high for children with a low body weight, Dr Davide Tassinari and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, said. The case was published in Pediatric Neurology. In the past, the US' Food and Drug Administration has warned \u00a0black liquorice can lead to irregular heartbeats, and other health problems when consumed by adults in large quantities. The glycyrrhizin causes the kidneys to excrete potassium, and low levels of the compound can make the heart beat dangerously fast or irregularly. Glycyrrhizin also leads to salt and water retention which can be a problem for people with heart failure or high blood pressure, it said. Other studies have shown glycyrrhizinc can\u00a0increase blood pressure or cause muscle weakness and chronic fatigue.

Keith Ballantine, 68, was struck down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome after consuming too many of the sweets.

Former foreign office minister Mark Simmonds also has an advertisement board behind the goal at Boston United's football ground funded by the taxpayer. Mr Simmonds, who represents Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire until May, is leaving Parliament because expenses are not sufficient to allow his young family to live with him in London. In the 2013/14 financial year he claimed\u00a0170,841.21 in expenses, which included \u00a310,000 for his sports advertising at Boston United and elsewhere. Within his office costs he claimed for the \u00a3100 cost of sponsoring his local hospital radio station.

Mr Simmonds, a former Foreign Office minister, says all the expense claims were within the rules and the Boston United board was approved by watchdog Ipsa in advance of the claim. Ipsa has also rejected a complaint about sponsorship and refused to investigate because of a lack of\u00a0'sufficient evidence'. Local councillor Robin Hunter-Clarke, who is standing for UKIP in Boston and Skegness in May, told the Daily Mirror: 'To pretend he is sponsoring a hospital radio show, boasting of his generosity while in fact charging the taxpayer, is pretty low.'

But the MP has said he cannot understand why his claims are controversial. He told MailOnline: 'It is a load of nonsense. All the expenses were properly claimed and approved by Ipsa. I even emailed them pictures of the advertising board before I claimed and they approved it.

He also made more than \u00a3500,000 by selling a house on which the taxpayer paid the mortgage interest. Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a five-bedroom house in Putney, south-west London, for \u00a3650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed \u00a32,000 a month for the mortgage interest.

King Felipe swapped his usual grey suit and blue tie for white tie and the jewellery and regalia of state. The royals, who welcomed President Santos and his wife to Spain in an official ceremony on Thursday, hosted the dinner in their honour. The Colombian First Lady looked glamorous in a floor-length blush dress with a sheer black patterned overlay with a sash tied at the waist. Like Letizia, she wore her hair in a chic up-do.

During the dinner Felipe gave a speech to 100 invited guests which included Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in which he assured President Santos that he can rely on 'the full support of Spain' in the 'noble proposition' of achieving peace with FARC guerillas in Colombia, reports Fox News Latino. Santos, who travelled to Madrid with his wife and six Cabinet ministers, said that his state visit reinforced the 'excellent' relationship between his country and Spain. He said: 'Spain is a nation that has always been by our side, always supporting us, always accompanying us.'

On Thursday Felipe and Letizia welcomed Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to Madrid with an official  ceremony at El Pardo palace outside Madrid. Letizia, 42, who looked chic in a nude skirt and blouse with black detailing, walked with the Colombian first lady Maria Clemencia Rodriguez during the event. The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

But many dog and cat foods are not all they seem. Research by vets has shown many popular tinned foods contain high quantities of meat not on the label. One beef stew dog food was found to be predominantly chicken. Of the 17 pet foods subjected to DNA testing at Nottingham University, 14 contained meats that were not spelled out on the can. As good as it looks?\u00a063 per cent of meat detected in Bakers As Good As It Looks Succulent Stew \u2018with beef\u2019 was chicken and 22 per cent was pork. Only 15 per cent was beef . Researcher Kin-Chow Chang, a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said misleading labelling could put dogs and cats at risk of serious allergic reactions. Latest figures show Britons spend \u00a31billion a year on more than 400,000 tons of tinned pet food. More than three quarters of the nation\u2019s eight million cats and almost half of the nine million dogs eat canned food. Professor Chang tested ten popular dog foods and seven types of cat food for DNA of cows, pigs, chickens and horses. None of the tins had horsemeat in them, but most contained beef, pork or chicken despite it not being mentioned on the label. Some of the \u2018beef\u2019 foods actually contained more pork or chicken. For instance, 63 per cent of meat detected in Bakers As Good As It Looks Succulent Stew \u2018with beef\u2019 was chicken and 22 per cent was pork. Only 15 per cent was beef. Not all brands were criticised \u2013 all of Encore\u2019s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled . Pedigree dog food labelled as being \u2018with beef\u2019 had far more chicken and pork than beef, and 81 per cent of the meat detected in Felix Complete cat food was chicken or pork \u2013 despite it being the \u2018beef\u2019 version. But not all brands were criticised \u2013 all of Encore\u2019s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled. Professor Chang said the research suggested \u2018a considerable mismatch in the labelling standard of the pet food industry and what the purchaser would reasonably expect\u2019. He added: \u2018In a human situation, this would be completely unacceptable. If I was to buy a tin of ham, I wouldn\u2019t want to be eating rabbit as well.\u2019 The foods complied with the law, which allows the phrase \u2018with beef\u2019, even if beef is not the main meat. But writing in journal Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica, Professor Chang called on manufacturers to make labels clearer, allowing \u2018more informed choices \u2026 particularly important for pets with food allergies, reduce the risk of product misinterpretation \u2026 and avoid potential religious concerns\u2019. Cats Protection\u2019s Maggie Roberts said pet food makers follow guidance laid down by the EU, adding: \u2018It may be beneficial for these guidelines to be amended so the information is clearer \u2026 to allow people to make a more informed choice.\u2019 The Pet Food Manufacturers Association said makers may use meat from different animals as supply levels fluctuate but the nutritional quality does not vary.", "label": 0.22727273404598236, "predicted": 0.5252727270126343}, "259": {"text": "Little Amie Rose suffers from a rare blood disease - and as a result, has already undergone 60 blood transfusions at the age of just five. The youngster has Diamond Blackfan Anaemia and to treat the condition, she has to go into hospital every four weeks for a blood transfusion. The disorder, which means her body cannot produce red blood cells, is so rare it affects only around 125 people in the country. Amie Rose (pictured right receiving one of her regular blood transfusions in September 2013) has Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which means her body cannot produce red blood cells . When she was born, Amie had a slight heart murmur, but doctors told her mother Jo, from Horley, Surrey, that it should go away in six weeks. Mrs Rose, 44, said: 'When I took Amie back for her check-up they said she looked a bit pale and they decided to take her in for a blood test. 'The results came back and the doctors said she had to have an emergency blood transfusion as there were not enough red blood cells in her body. 'We were then transferred to Great Ormond's Street hospital to have a bone marrow biopsy and told that Amie would have to have regular blood transfusions.' Amie (pictured with mother Jo and father Gordon) has to go into hospital every four weeks for a transfusion . Amie (pictured at seven weeks) was given an emergency transfusion after doctors decided to take a blood test during a check-up because she looked pale. She then had a bone marrow biopsy . But just a couple of days after being sent home, Amie stopped breathing and her parents took her back to hospital. Doctors were able to stabilise Amie's iron levels but she had to have an emergency operation to insert a port running from her jugular vein into her heart. 'Amie stopped breathing and we had to rush her back into hospital where they starved her and put back on a milk formula,' her mother added. 'We were so scared of what might happen to her but we just wanted Amie to survive.' Every week Amie has to get a nurse to attach a tube with a pump at the bottom to remove the excess iron from her blood. The pump stays attached to the port six days a week.. These pictures show the effects of steroid treatment to treat the rare blood disorder on Amie in October 2011 . Amie's father Gordon, 53, said: 'The port restricts Amie from doing any contact sport and we have to be careful when we pick her up as we could knock the needle in her port. 'The pump is essential for Amie as too much iron in the blood can be fatal and can cause major organ failures. 'Just before her fourth birthday, Amie's port blocked and we were rushed into hospital otherwise it could cause pressure on the jugular. 'Surgeons had to remove the port from her left hand side and insert it on the opposite side. 'We have to make sure that the port is always clean which can be difficult as Amie has a low immune system and she contracted tonsillitis seven times in less than a year. 'She now has a course on antibiotics every two weeks that helps her fight off any illnesses.' Amie's parents are hoping her body will start to regulate the iron in her body so that she only has to wear the pump at night time. Her parents are hopeful that Amie will become eligible for a bone marrow transplant soon, which would 'fix' her, meaning she would not need to continue with the current treatment method . Her father, a building services engineer, said they are hoping Amie will only have to have the pump attached at night time by the end of the year. 'After that we would be hoping that her iron levels stay at a reasonable rate and then she would be eligible for a bone marrow transplant. 'This procedure would 'fix' Amie and she wouldn't need to have all of this current treatment. 'It is an exciting but nerve racking experience - as there are so few people in the UK who has this illness doctors cannot predict what Amie's body will do. 'It would be nice for Amie to have the bone marrow transplant especially now she is getting older and she is starting to get remarks from other children at school.' He aaded: 'It is now all a waiting process to see how Amie's body will react in the next couple of years. 'You hear good stories and bad stories but we are just keeping our fingers crossed that Amie stays our brave, happy little girl.' Red blood cells (pictured) are vital because they circulate oxygen around the body . Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) is a rare blood disease where the bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells. Red blood cells are necessary for life because they circulate oxygen around the body. Patients are usually diagnosed before the age of two and require treatment to compensate for their lack of red cell production. DBA can cause fatigue, poor growth, lack of appetite and a pale complexion. In about a half of cases patients also suffer associated congenital abnormalities. Some affected children are short for their age and may have delayed puberty. DBA patients also have a slightly elevated risk of certain types of cancer. Many DBA patients are treated with blood transfusions, often monthly,\u00a0to bring their red blood cell count up to an acceptable level. But frequent transfusions cause an accumulation of iron in the body. Because an overload of iron can cause damage to major organs if it is not properly managed, patients must take a 'chelation' drug to remove excess iron from their bodies. This can take the form of a nightly infusion of medication via a needle over a ten hour period and in other cases, an oral drug can be taken daily.

Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national,\u00a0lied his way into casinos he had been banned from by producing fake ID cards and driving licences. Once inside, the unemployed 61-year-old\u00a0would sit at card tables for hours, deftly making marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. Sentenced: Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, would sit at casino tables for hours deftly making the marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. He was jailed for 18 months today . The technique allowed him to swindle the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London out of \u00a343,400 in just one week. Lacatos was arrested at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton, in March 2014 after staff recognised him and raised the alarm. After his arrest, Lacatos attempted to flee to Romania from Luton Airport but was caught in the departure lounge by detectives on 20 November 2014. He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court today. His conviction is the one of the first for \u2018card marking\u2019 - a technique which is thought to have made the skilled fraudster hundreds of thousands of pounds over his six-year spree. Lacatos fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham. Lacatos, pictured bottom right at a card table in Playboy Club in Mayfair, London, used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years . He used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years. The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: \u2018The defendant is a well-known casino cheat. He is known to mark cards at three card poker thereby causing loss to operators across the UK. \u2018To facilitate his entry into the various casinos, knowing he had been previously banned from such establishments, the allegations behind the fraud in this case are that he used false names to register with the various casinos supporting his applications with counterfeit documentation on every occasion.\u2019 Scam: The bends and dents, pictured, helped Lacatos identify what other players at the table were holding . She added: \u2018Over the week of using the false identity at the Playboy Casino in London, it was discovered that the defendant had cheated at three card poker by bending or marking the cards. \u2018The cards were notably aces and this bending of the cards enabled him to know when the card were being dealt. \u2018The CCTV showed that the defendant noticeably increased his bets of \u00a310 to \u00a320 to \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per game. \u2018CCTV also showed that the defendant always sat at the first box position which is nearest to the shuffle machine at the card table. Lacatos spent hours sitting at casino tables for making tiny marks and creases in the cards. He would always sit at the first box position, which is nearest to the card shuffle machine and the table. This seat meant he was given the best possible view of the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle. The poker player would then watch carefully as the pack was dealt, noting the creases or marks which revealed which card it was. \u2018This ensured he could clearly see the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle,\u2019 she said. \u2018He was able to take a sum of \u00a343,400 from the casino in total. That figure includes winning his bets back and the profit made by cheating. \u2018As a result of these findings the matter was reported to the police, the packs of cards were handed over and were analysed and were found to have been marked. \u2018That caused further enquiries to be made and an investigation showed that the defendant had been involved in various other incidents around the UK and had gained access to various casinos by using further false identities.' Lacatos\u2019 placed bets worth \u00a325,200 at the Playboy club and won them all back plus a profit of \u00a318,200. Ms Fawcett continued: \u2018Between 29 March 2014 and 31 March 2014 he joined the Northampton Rubicon casino again with a false identity. \u2018He was recognised in that casino however on the 31 March 2014 - the police were notified, they arrested the defendant in the casino.\u2019 Lacatos was cautioned and later bailed to return to Charing Cross police station for a full interview with an interpreter. But he failed to attend and offended  twice more while on bail. Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than \u00a340,000 . \u2018The defendant was finally arrested on 20 November 2014 at Luton airport whilst about to leave the UK on a flight to Romania,\u2019 said Ms Fawcett. Police seized \u00a33,500 from Lacatos who was carrying his own passport and ID card at the time. Stuart Stevens, for Lacatos, said the married cheat was from the \u2018very, very poor\u2019 region of southern Romania. Lacatos has simply printed bogus Hungarian and Romanian identity cards from the internet and laminated them. \u2018He tells me there is not a big check at casinos - they want your money so they let you in,\u2019 said Mr Stevens. \u2018He realises his time of making this money is over, he wanted to get back to Romania, to his family. He appreciates just how serious this is and he throws himself on the mercy of the court.\u2019 Sentencing Lacatos at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Alexander Layton QC said Lacatos \u2018deliberately planned\u2019 his crimes and used a \u2018large number\u2019 of false names. \u2018After you had been arrested you attempted to flee the country, two of the offences were committed while you were on bail and you have previous convictions in Romania for offences relating to false identity documents,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have pleaded guilty to 18 counts - all of which were related to a campaign of cheating in casinos up and down the country over a period stretching back some six years.\u2019 Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim\u2019s Casino also in London.

Built in the early 12th Century it is one of few medieval castles which remain in Europe and is thought to have been the home of Pope Pius II and III at one time. The property, whose owners wish to keep themselves and the castle's name unknown, is being sold by Sotheby's International for 28 million euros - almost \u00a320million. Scroll down for video . A medieval castle in Tuscany set over more than 1500 acres has gone on sale for just under \u00a320million making it the largest private home on the property market . The castle has its own restaurant where wines made from the grapes in its vineyards are served alongside produced farmed from the grounds . While it is not known who first lived in the castle or commissioned its construction the property remained in the hands of one prominent family for centuries. The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived there intermittently from the 15th Century. Two of the family's most notable members,\u00a0Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III. Little is known of how the noble family cultivated their wealth other than that many of their riches were acquired through trading. Having spent decades in the ownership of the family, the castle it changed hands sometime in the 1920s. The new owner remained anonymous, selling on the sprawling estate again in the 1980s. It has since remained in the possession of its current owners who refused to disclose why they were moving on. While estate agents are reluctant to reveal exactly where in the rolling Tuscan hills the special property can be found, they promised it to be one of rare value. 'It's very rare in Italy to have a medieval castle, there are so many that came before and after, mostly after, but to find a medieval one is rare,' said John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International. 'All the original fireplaces and ceilings are in tact. It's a very special opportunity.' While in total the estate has more than 100 bedrooms most are found in farmhouses and smaller properties scattered across its grounds. These are rented out as holiday accommodation while its vineyard and restaurant attracts diners. In the castle itself are 10 bedrooms and as many bathrooms, a drawing room and dining room. Elsewhere on its sprawling grounds are sunflower fields and farmland, added Mr Jonk. The villa just east of Sienna is one of few from the early 12th Century which remain in Italy. All its fireplaces and ceilings have been preserved from their original state . Aside from the property's 10-bedroom main castle there are several farmhouses scattered around its grounds from the same era . The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived in the castle intermittently from the 15th Century and two of the family's most notable members, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III . The castle is a very rare find in Italy because it dates back to medieval times, according to John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International . Mysteriously the existence of the castle is not widely known and it has never really been filmed or appeared on television . The castle also has its own chapel and vineyard. It belonged to the same family for generations before being sold privately in 1920 . 'There's a lot of woodland, there's a vineyard. 'From some parts of the property there are views of Siena too.' Although the property is one of the few remaining of its kind in Italy it has remained mysteriously off the radar for decades. 'That's the interesting part - there have been television crews that have come from Rome over the years and have interviewed people in the restaurant in the castle but it hasn't really been used for filming or anything like that,' Mr Jonk said. In its restaurant staff serve red wine and food produced on the grounds. With herds of boar and deer roaming its fields too there is no shortage of wildlife to entertain visitors. 'When people talk about organic foods, this is what is meant. In Italy everything is still quite good that way, it's very organic.' Despite its large price tag, Mr Jonk added the property had attracted attention from all over the world. 'We have had interest from European buyers and non-European buyers. 'It's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but, as I tell my clients, to find an exclusive property in London nowadays wouldn't cost much less.'

He is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in Zimbabwe just days earlier. Mr Lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to Zambia.

Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying a company to write their assignments. Two students from the University of Newcastle have already been expelled and more are facing disciplinary action at four other intuitions after being identified as using the MyMaster company which wrote essays for Chinese international students, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website which charged up to $1000 per assignment and was used by hundreds of students across 12 NSW universities. Ms Dou reportedly had 100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney before the website was shut down. It was claimed that MyMaster had an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. The University of Newcastle confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that it had conducted internal investigations and in addition to the two expulsions it suspended eight international students and found 21 others guilty of misconduct. The majority of students found guilty were given fail grades for 2014 subjects. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Two students from the University of Newcastle have been expelled and eight have been suspended . The four other worst-hit universities told the Herald they were still conducting investigations with accused students \u2013 including three at the University of Sydney, 11 at University of Technology Sydney, 19 at University of NSW, and 43 at Macquarie University. The maximum penalty for academic misconduct is expulsion at all institutions except UNSW, where it is suspension. UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander told the\u00a0ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.' She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. 'We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,' she said. 'When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,' she explained. Students (a stock photo is shown) reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: 'Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!' Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website. The company's Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. 'We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,' a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia contacted Ms Dou for comment but did not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise 'many people do, for a variety of reasons'. 'Some students plagiarise because they don't fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,' a warning on their website reads. Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying the company to write their assignments . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is 'all your own work'. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of 'dishonest plagiarism', which is when they 'knowingly presenting another person's work as one's own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source'. And 'engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration'. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University's high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University's Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion.

Brendan Rodgers' in-form Reds survived a first-half fright at Swansea on Monday night before emerging 1-0 winners to cut the gap on fourth-placed United to two points. Mignolet had to produce fine stops to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson in a first half Swansea dominated but Jordan Henderson's fortunate winner gave Liverpool their fifth successive Barclays Premier League victory. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet punches a cross clear during his side's 1-0 win against Swansea . Captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Mignolet after the Reds' fifth successive Premier League victory . 'We showed the character and resilience during the game that you need if you're going to be successful,' Mignolet said. 'This was our sixth successive clean sheet away from home and we have to keep that going until the end of the season. 'You keep those clean sheets as a whole team. Everyone is playing together, doing their job and willing to fight for each other.' Liverpool have not lost in the league since a 3-0 defeat at United on December 14 when the stuttering Mignolet was dropped and replaced by Brad Jones. But Mignolet soon reclaimed his place and both he and Liverpool have gone from strength to strength ever since, the Merseysiders now unbeaten in 13 league games and Rodgers insisting they can catch second-placed Manchester City who are currently four points better off than his men. United's visit on Sunday might go a long way to determining if that ambition is feasible but Mignolet insists Liverpool have to focus solely on themselves and not their rivals for a top-four spot. Liverpool's players celebrate after Jordan Henderson's decisive second half goal at the Liberty Stadium . Mignolet pulls off an acrobatic save to deny Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal . 'This win sets up the next game and that's a big game of course,' Mignolet said. 'But we don't have to make too much of it, there's three points there and we have to try to do our best to get the win at home. 'We just have to look at our own performances, there's no point in looking at the other teams, and keep doing what we've been doing in the last few months. 'We've still got all the big teams to play but the important thing is we don't look too forward ahead of ourselves.' Mignolet does not resemble the goalkeeper who visibly appeared anxious and made regular mistakes during the first half of the season. As well as his precious first-half saves at the Liberty Stadium he was commanding in the air and punched well under pressure, but he puts his impressive record down to those in front of him. 'As a goalkeeper you're depending on the rest of the team to keep those clean sheets,' he said. 'You can't do that on your own and that's what's pleasing. Henderson scores the only goal of the game as the ball cannons off his shin fortuitously . The England midfielder celebrates in front of Liverpool's travelling contingent at the Liberty Stadium .

Of course, as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space, but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency. The discovery was made by a team of scientists including Dr John Pasley of the York Plasma Institute in the Department of Physics. A team of scientists that included York University made the discovery. They fired an ultra-intense laser on fluids in a laboratory. When they did this, the plasma in the fluid produced a sound wave. This process is thought to also be taking place in stars (sun pictured) They found that, when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star, it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma. Dr Pasley told MailOnline that the phenomenon is 'more common in younger stars' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings. It would be less common in more mature stars, like our sun. To make the finding, the team studied fluids in motion in a laboratory and found that, when plasma is hit with an ultra-intense laser, it produces some strange effects. Using a method not too dissimilar to how a speed camera works, they were able to observe how the fluid moves at the point it is struck. Often called the fourth state of matter, plasma is a state of matter where heat or another energy has been added to a gas. This makes many of its atoms release some, or all, of their electrons. The resultant electrically charged gas is said to be \u2018ionised\u2019, and when enough atoms are ionised, the gas is said to be a plasma. Interestingly, plasma is thought to make up more than 99 per cent of all matter in the universe. A trillionth of a second after the laser hits, plasma was found to flow quickly from areas of high density to low density. In so doing, the plasma between the regions of different density produces pressure pulses, or a sound wave. However, with a frequency of nearly a trillion hertz, the sound wave produced is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal. It is also almost the highest frequency possible in such a material. According to the scientists, a prime location for this rare event occurring is on the surface of stars. The process is thought to be taking place on stars like the sun, pictured, where plasma is in abundance. In fact, plasma is thought to make up 99 per cent of matter in the universe . \u2018When they are accumulating new material, stars could generate sound in a very similar manner to that which we observed in the laboratory - so the stars might be singing - but, since sound cannot propagate through the vacuum of space, no-one can hear them,\u2019 said Dr Pasley. However, he noted that it would be difficult to directly observe this effect in stars, as the sound waves do not propagate into the space around the star. \u2018It was initially hard to determine the origin of the acoustic signals, but our model produced results that compared favourably with the wavelength shifts observed in the experiment,\u2019 added Dr Alex Robinson, from the Plasma Physics Group at the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u2019s Central Laser Facility in Oxfordshire. \u2018This showed that we had discovered a new way of generating sound from fluid flows.

GCHQ was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic. The Intelligence and Security Committee said the central claims made by the Guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by American whistle-blower Edward Snowden were wrong and it cleared the Government\u2019s listening station of wrongdoing. After an 18-month inquiry, the committee dismissed the claims that GCHQ had \u2018blanket coverage\u2019 of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages. In reality, it said, GCHQ can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a \u2018tiny fraction\u2019 of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process. The committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the \u2018highest intelligence value\u2019, and these amounted to several thousand a day. Tory MP Mark Field, a member of the committee, said: \u2018The big mistake that Snowden and the Guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance. \u2018The truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined. \u2018That point was never really made by the Guardian, who gave the impression that with every phone call, every email and every text message, the public had a spy on their shoulder.\u2019 Labour MP Hazel Blears said the \u2018two main claims\u2019 made off the back of the Snowden leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate. \u2018What we\u2019ve found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised, lawful, necessary and proportionate. Labour MP Hazel Blears chaired the press conference on the Intelligence and Security Committee's long-awaited report into Britain's spy agencies . GCHQ Headquarters, based in Cheltenham, is the Government's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people's 'communications' to uncover terror threats . \u2018But what we\u2019ve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system. 'It is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance, indiscriminate surveillance.\u2019 Another committee member, Tory MP Dr Julian Lewis, compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack. The agency does not have the \u2018legal authority, the resources or the technical capability\u2019 to intercept such vast amounts of material, the report concluded. The committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation. 'The allegation arising from the [Snowden] leaks is that GCHQ \u2018hoover up\u2019 and collect all internet communications. Some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said \u2018the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time\u2019, referring to the \u2018apparent ubiquity of surveillance\u2019. 'We have explored whether this is the case. It is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints, it is not: GCHQ cannot conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications. \u2018It would be unlawful for them to do so, since it would not be necessary or proportionate, as required by [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]. Moreover, GCHQ do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications' Britain's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual's emails, phone calls and other communications. The warrants are signed off by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (left) or Home Secretary Theresa May (right) Shami Chakrabarti, director of rights campaign group Liberty, said the Parliamentary committee was 'clueless and ineffective' Councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than GCHQ and MI6, it emerged last night. Town halls accessed records of telephone, text or internet use 2,110 times last year, the Interception of Communications Commissioner said. That compares to 1,291 approvals for GCHQ and 652 for MI6. MI5, which makes the vast bulk of such applications, was given 48,639 authorisations last year. Councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping, benefit fraud, and trading standards \u2018crimes\u2019. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: \u2018The use by some town halls seems excessive \u2013 as if they were acting out their James Bond fantasies. I would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high. \u2018There is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers.\u2019 Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, released 1.7million files in one of the biggest security leaks in US history. He fled to Russia, where he was granted asylum. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, condemned the report, adding: \u2018No doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies\u2019 motto of \u201cno scrutiny for us, no privacy for you\u201d \u2013 but what an appalling deal for the British public.\u2019 A Guardian spokesman said: \u2018The Snowden revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world, and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight.

Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp. Ivan Rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on-rushing Joe Hart to give Barcelona the lead against Man City . Rakitic loops the ball over Hart and past Vincent Kompany to earn Barcelona a 1-0 lead at the Nou Camp . When he signed in the summer what was the reaction? There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons \u2013 firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season. Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago? Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career. Is Rakitic better than Cesc? Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement. The Croatia international challenges for the ball with Manchester City midfielder James Milner . Rakitic was brought to Barcelona from Sevilla for \u00a314million to replace Cesc Fabregas, who joined Chelsea . And those characteristics are? He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Bar\u00e7a last Saturday away at Eibar. Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot. He\u2019s a very complete midfielder. Who brought him to Spain? Sevilla signed him from Schalke for \u20ac2.5m. It was another work of genius from the club\u2019s Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit. Rakitic (laying down on left of trophy) captained Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2014 . Rakitic was born in Switzerland but plays international football for Croatia . Did he consider England? His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain. When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer. He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead. The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages. And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday? It will. And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven. Rakitic is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after opening the scoring against City on Wednesday . Midfielder Rakitic is joined in celebration by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr . How did that work out for Luis Enrique? Badly. Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic. Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta. \u2018They are great players but they are not getting any younger,\u2019 Paul Clement told me after the game. Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match. Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park. When he is at his best, he is their engine. Now he\u2019s back in the team for good? He didn\u2019t start against Malaga and Barca lost 1-0. He then played and scored against Granada. He is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at Barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at Sevilla. When he scored against Grandada he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room \u2013 the German keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and he even said of Luis Enrique: \u2018He knows what he is doing, we have to trust in him.\u2019 Former Sevilla and Schalke midfielder Rakitic attempts to escape the attention of Yaya Toure .", "label": 0.30769231636077166, "predicted": 0.36592939496040344}, "274": {"text": "An Iraqi man who fled to America to escape the horrors of the Islamic State was shot dead as he took pictures of the first snowfall he had ever seen.

Oliver Gobat's\u00a0body was found in the passenger seat of his car in April last year, burned beyond all recognition on a remote track on St Lucia's exclusive Cap Estate - less than two miles from the luxury hotel his family owned. The popular businessman - who was born on the island, but raised in Surrey - had been shot twice in the head before the car was set alight, in what is thought to have been an attempt to destroy any forensic evidence. Killing: Oliver Gobat was shot twice in the head, before his car was set alight on a quiet road in St Lucia . Shock: Family and friends were stunned by the killing of the popular businessman, born on the island . Jealousy: Mr Gobat, 38, ran the luxury Cap Maison - and was involved in a \u00a35.4million deal for another resort . The killing left family and friends - including Carol Vorderman - stunned, but an inquest into his death has revealed Mr Gobat received death threats in the run up to his murder. The inquest, being held in Working, Surrey, heard that Mr Gobat was helping to organise the \u00a35.4million ($8million) takeover of The Landings, a luxury beach resort on St Lucia which had become insolvent. But a rival bidder organised a 'smear campaign' against Mr Gobat, and the 38-year-old had received death threats - which he hid from his family. Mother Helen Gobat told the hearing: 'He was the victim of a smear campaign. 'There was a blog set up called Pirates of the Caribbean. It was intended to damage his reputation. 'We subsequently learned he had received death threats.' His brother Adam - who said Mr Gobat was a very likeable person - added: 'It transpires that the person who was behind the smear campaign was a rival bidder to buy The Landings. 'That person is a UK citizen.' The victim's brother also revealed that after The Landings deal was completed following Mr Gobat's death, another signatory to the consortium received a death threat. Threats: Mother Helen, pictured with husband Theo, told an inquest there was a smear campaign against him . Success: 'He's a good looking, successful chap in St Lucia and it's a small community so there's a lot of jealousy that goes around,' his mother told the inquest in Woking, Surrey . Anger: The family have also been left frustrated with the lack of progress made by local police into the case . Mrs Gobat told the coroner her son, who had worked on St Lucia for 10 years before his death, had probably never expected anyone to kill him over his business dealings but admitted there was likely to have been 'jealousy' towards his success on the island. Mr Gobat ran the luxury Cap Maison hotel with his brothers Adam and Rufus and was a popular figure on the holiday island, welcoming the likes of Amy Winehouse and model Kelly Brook to the boutique hotel. He grew up in Surrey, where he played cricket for his county junior team, and also lived in Adelaide, Australia, before settling back in St Lucia - an independent state of the Commonwealth - to concentrate on the family business. 'Whatever he did he liked to succeed and he was very close to achieving it,' Mrs Gobat told the inquest. 'Thinking the unthinkable': His family questioned whether he would have taken threats over a legitimate business deal seriously . 'He's a good looking, successful chap in St Lucia and it's a small community so there's a lot of jealousy that goes around. 'There were competitors in property and I guess they didn't want him to be any more successful by putting the deal together that he was putting together. 'It was a case of thinking the unthinkable. Why would he think somebody would knock him off for putting through a legitimate business deal with legitimate business partners?' Mrs Gobat also criticised the police investigation in St Lucia, saying 'basic' errors had been made from the beginning, including moving the Range Rover on the night her son was found dead and failing to cordon off the area. At the time police sources were reported as saying that Mr Gobat's death was 'no ordinary murder' and it had 'all the hallmarks of a professional killing' - yet they have failed to charge anyone in connection with the killing. British police have also appeared to be reticent to get involved in the case, with\u00a0Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab taking up the families pleas for help last December. The Gobat family - who have a family mansion in Esher, Surrey - has since employed a private investigator to look into the case. 'I hope that his murder wasn't senseless and whoever is behind it is properly dealt with,' she said. Assistant Coroner for Surrey, Dr Karin Englehart, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, saying the 'manner and mechanism' of Mr Gobat's death were clear. Dr Englehart said it was not her place to comment on the possible reasons for his murder. She said: 'The manner of Ollie's death is a terrible, terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. No-one should die in this way. 'It had to be someone or some others, for whatever reason, and that is the purpose of other courts, a criminal court, to deal with.

The station aired part of the interview on Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Cornell said in the interview that both he and ISIS members worked together on the terror plot, which involved planting pipe bombs and going on a public shooting rampage.

The\u00a0world of dog breeding was rocked by scandal last night amid allegations that a prize-winner at this year's Crufts was deliberately poisoned. In a plot straight from the pages of a detective drama, a breeder claimed her \u00a350,000 Irish setter died after he was fed meat laced with toxins. But she believes the poisoner mistakenly targeted the wrong dog and had intended to kill another of her Irish setters that looks very similar. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show. Tests found that Jagger \u2013 pedigree name Thendara Satisfaction \u2013 had eaten cubed beef laced with up to three poisons. However co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott believes the intended victim was four-year-old Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, who won best of breed on the day Jagger competed. The two almost identical looking dogs had switched places on the benches where entrants sit before and after going in the show ring at the NEC in Birmingham. Jagger died in the arms of joint owner Alexandra Lauwers at her home in Belgium. She reported his death to police and animal welfare officials there, and to the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts. CCTV footage from the NEC is being reviewed but West Midlands Police and the RSPCA here have yet to be informed officially. The target? Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, at Crufts with co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott . There has been controversy over the increasing number of foreign dogs allowed to compete at Crufts, which attracts more than 20,000 entries from 200 breeds. This year's competition ended last night with Knopa, a foreign-owned Scottish terrier, being named best in show. But Jagger's owners say he could have been fed the poisoned meat by a 'random psychopathic dog hater' or a jealous rival breeder. The Kennel Club said it had not heard of such an incident before and promised to assist any police inquiries. Last night Mrs Milligan-Bott, 56, said she had 'done nothing but cry' over Jagger's death. She said: 'We think this is the work of some random psychopathic dog hater who decided to visit Crufts with one thing in mind, rather than any sort of targeted attack.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, who breeds and shows Afghan hounds and Irish setters with her husband Jeremy Bott, 66, said tests showed Jagger had been killed by a 'pesticide-type' poison. She said: 'Some sadistic person out there poisoned our dog. Crufts is a high-profile event and we live in a very anti-dog society.' The holding area where dogs are 'benched' before and after competing is open to the public, although they are asked not to touch the animals. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show . Clare Balding posted a message on Twitter about the incident after it was confirmed that a dog had died . She plans to inform West Midlands Police of the circumstances surrounding Jagger's death when she receives the written toxicology report later this week. Mrs Milligan-Bott said she had heard of rumours of skullduggery involving other breeders at shows but had not come across anything like this in 30 years of competing. 'I don't believe it had anything to do with other competitors,' she said. 'We have had so many calls [from other breeders who were at the show]... everybody has been pulling together and offering support.' She is convinced Jagger was fed poisoned meat when he was on the bench on one of the handful of occasions he was left on his own for up to 15 minutes \u2013 the only times he was unattended. She is unsure if that was before or after he entered the show ring. She told Dog World magazine's website that nothing appeared untoward until both dogs returned to her home in Kilsby, Northamptonshire, after competing on the first day of the show on Thursday. 'All the dogs were all running and playing together and Jagger seemed a bit tired, unable to keep up with the others,' she said. 'Three or four hours later, after getting back to Belgium, he collapsed and by the time the vet arrived he was dead. The post-mortem showed that two or three different poisons were used and that it is likely it was administered on Thursday morning. 'We're now waiting for exact toxicology reports. Whoever did this knew what they were doing, trying to get exactly the right type of poison with a slow release.' The animal had won second in his class when he was at Crufts and his owner think he was poisoned there . The dogs had changed places on the bench after one became agitated about being near a bitch in season, it is understood. In another twist, Mrs Milligan-Bott said the best of breed and challenge certificates won by Noodle had mysteriously been taken from the benches at some point. 'And at Richmond last year someone let one of my dogs off its bench and he went missing, before being found on someone else's bench,' she added. 'It's been suggested that someone's really got it in for us, and to not let it get to us. There do seem to be too many coincidences.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, whose setters were named Thendara after her kennels, which has a worldwide reputation for breeding champion show dogs, added: 'It's turning into such a nasty sport. I went back to Crufts on Saturday but I was like a zombie \u2013 I just thought, 'I don't want to do this any more'.' A post on her Facebook page outlined the death of 'our beautiful boy' Jagger and warned other competitors not to leave their dogs unattended at Crufts. At her home in Tongeren, near Liege, Mrs Lauwers, 34, a full-time breeder who takes her dogs to see the elderly in residential homes, said: 'They have not only taken away a dog, or merely a pet, they have taken away a family member. 'It should be a hobby and nothing more. To think he may have been poisoned by a rival at a dog show just makes it even harder to take. 'How people can resort to killing a helpless animal from jealousy or hate for a dog in a competition is too much to comprehend. I know people take it seriously but If you want to target me, smash my windows or something \u2013 don't go and kill my pet dog. Jagger took part in the competition on Thursday and achieved second place in his class at Crufts . The dog's owners said he appeared to be following the footsteps of 2010 best of breed winner Mr Jingles . Jagger fell ill when he returned to his other owners in Belgium and died before a vet was able to get to him . The title of best in show was won last night by a five-year-old Scottish terrier named Knopa. Bred in the US and owned by Russians, Knopa, who competes under the name McVan's To Russia With Love, was shown by American Rebecca Cross, who said it marked Knopa's retirement as a show dog. Dublin, a flat-coated retriever from Sweden which had won the gundog category, was overall runner-up. The ceremony was temporarily halted when the stage was stormed by a protester waving a sign saying: 'Mutts against Crufts.' 'He could have been targeted for being a foreign dog, there's a lot of ill feeling from some camps towards them for some reason. 'But first and foremost he was our pet and we are absolutely distraught. He died right in front of me in my arms, there was nothing we could do. My little boy is only nine, he is devastated.' Mrs Lauwers took Jagger's body to a clinic. She said they found 'green and black substances inside cubes of beef' in his stomach. 'Jagger loved people and he loved food - he would have just trusted whoever gave it to him,' she said. On her Facebook page, she added: 'To the person who has done it, hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed our love, family member and best friend to our son.' She is due to give a full statement to police today and toxicology reports are due to be completed on Wednesday or Thursday. Jagger cost around \u00a3850 as a puppy and won best of breed at the Ladies' Kennel Association show at the NEC in December. Because of his pedigree, success in shows and value as a stud dog, he could have commanded a price of up to \u00a350,000, experts said. Jagger was not insured for any particular sum of money, however, only by normal pet insurance which covers vets' fees. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'The Kennel Club is deeply shocked and saddened to hear that Jagger the Irish setter died some 26 hours after leaving Crufts. 'We have spoken to his owners and our heartfelt sympathies go out to them. We understand that the toxicology report is due next week and until that time we cannot know the cause of this tragic incident.'

Scroll down for video . The pitch: Jesse Genet, CEO of DIY screenprinting company Lumi, failed to get an investment when she appeared on Shark Tank in a recent episode . Empty handed: The sharks felt that the 27-year-old's valuation in her company was too high and she refused to compromise on lower offers . Success: Shortly after the episode was taped, Genet applied for and was accepted into leading Silicon Valley start-up incubator Y Combinator . Shark Kevin O'Leary estimated that she was only taking back $100,000 in profits after taxes and found the $5million valuation a little aspirational. 'That\u2019s 50 times your free cash flow - It\u2019s ridiculous,' he said. O'Leary and fellow shark Laurie Greiner offered Genet an alternative deal, based on a much-lower valuation of her company, but Genet refused to budge, leaving the show empty handed. As she ended her bargaining with the sharks, Genet remained positive saying: 'I'm going to make this into a credible company'. And it appears she was right. Just one month after her episode aired she has already doubled her profits. Shortly after taping the show, Genet applied for and was accepted into Y Combinator, one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious start-up incubators. She joined the incubator in December and in just three months has increased her profits to $2.5 million by expanding her product line and redesigning her website.

Five suspects including a policeman who served in Chechnya have appeared in a Moscow court over the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, is pictured above . Another suspect is Zaur Dadayev, who is believed to have served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, part of the interior ministry of Chechnya.\u00a0Judge Nataliya Mushnikova said he has now made a statement confirming his involvement . Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The Investigative Committee, the state agency leading the investigation, applied to the court to formally arrest the suspects. All five will now remain in custody. Meanwhile a sixth man thought to be involved in Mr Nemtsov's death blew himself up  after being approached by police at his apartment block, Interfax said. The 30-year-old reportedly threw a grenade at officers in Grozny, Chechnya, on Saturday night before setting one off near himself. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev\u2019s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov.

Three unidentified suspects hide their faces using their jackets and jumpers while waiting behind bars in the courtroom . Aaimani Dadayeva, mother of Dadayev, said she was stunned at the arrest of her son. 'I was informed today that my son has been detained on suspicion of involvement in Boris Nemtsov's murder,' she told Interfax late on Saturday. 'I can't believe it. He could not have committed this crime.' Reports suggest the other suspects include Gubashev's younger brother Shagid and two men - Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev. Mr Bortnikov added that the developments had been reported to the president, but he stressed they were continuing 'necessary operative and investigative work' on the case. One suspect, whose face could not be seen, was escorted into the court building by two masked guards who held on to his collar . Another suspect pulled the hood of his grey jacket over his face and had his hands bound in front of him .

Russian policemen guard the yard of the court after the suspects arrived via bus and were taken inside . At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict. He was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and other politicians to alleged corruption. The shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing Putin for 'mad, aggressive' policies in Ukraine. Surveillance footage apparently showed a man climbing into a white getaway car and being driven away. Russian officials have denied any involvement, with President Vladimir Putin dubbing the murder a 'provocation'. In a speech with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends an annual expanded meeting of the Interior Ministry's Board on March 4. He said:\u00a0'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext' The body of Mr Nemtsov lies in a body bag in central Moscow in the hours after he was gunned down. He had been organising a march in opposition to the Ukraine conflict at the time of his death . 'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen. 'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.' He added that he would do all he could to ensure the killers were brought to justice, but has made no comment on the detentions. Russia's top investigative body said it was looking into several possible motives, including that Mr Nemtsov was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image. It said it was also examining possible connections to Islamic extremism and Mr Nemtsov's personal life.

But Mr Nemtsov's associates said they will only be satisfied if prosecutors track down whoever orchestrated the killing, and not just the people who pulled the trigger.

'The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered the attack.' Thousands of Russians paid their final respects to Mr Nemtsov when he was laid to rest in the capital earlier this week.

Neil Swarbrick apologised on Saturday night for wrongly red-carding Gareth McAuley in the second minute of West Brom's 3-0 loss at the Etihad Stadium, when it was team-mate Craig Dawson who committed a foul on Wilfried Bony. It followed last month's Old Trafford mistaken identity muddle that saw Sunderland's Wes Brown sent off by Roger East for bringing down Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao, when the offence in question was committed by John O'Shea. Referees' chief Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialled after Neil Swarbrick (right) wrongly sent off Gareth McAuley (left) in the second minute of West Brom's 3-0 defeat by  Manchester City . The West Brom players emphatically protest the red card as McAuley is dismissed by referee Swarbrick . McAuley (right) appears to ask the referee if he's got the right man after Craig Dawson committed the foul . Asked why referees do not listen to players' on-field explanations of such circumstances, Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) general manager Riley said: 'The referee has got to make his decision based on what he thinks he's seen. His instincts often lead him to trust his judgement. 'It's one of the areas that would lend itself to technology. 'The game has stopped and there's time before we restart the game to have a look at something. That would provide the concrete evidence that would get the decision right. 'I think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology. West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes a challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley comes across in cover and gets the ball before the man . 'We've been open-minded to things like the goal-decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the Premier League. 'We need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate.' He added: 'We need to test it in live football. Until we do that, we won't know the impact on the game. 'Technology can be helpful but we don't want to destroy the fabric of the game, the fast-flowing spectacle we all love.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . McAuley walks past his furious manager Tony Pulis after the latest case of mistaken identity . Riley, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme, did not offer any confirmation that Swarbrick will referee in the next round of Premier League matches, following the international break. 'I've spoken to Neil quite a lot last night and this morning,' Riley said. 'Referees accept at every level your performance will be scrutinised. Any referee, when you come off and you've made a mistake, you're hurt, because you love the game. 'What you want to do is make the correct decision and when you don't there's that feeling that you've let yourself down and let your colleagues down. 'When they make mistakes, it's our job to make sure they understand the mistakes, learn from it and they put it right in the next game.' West Brom captain Darren Fletcher had urged Swarbrick not to leap into the decision to brandish a red card. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher urged Swarbrick to take his time with the decision before the red card . Fletcher told Match of the Day he had spoken to the referee and told him: 'Just make a sensible decision, it's the first minute of the game, take your time. Take your time because this is a massive decision that impacts the rest of the game.' Fletcher added: 'I was really surprised when he showed the red card. I think a lot of our players were - and then to the wrong player as well, which we were trying to say as well, but it fell on deaf ears.' West Brom boss Tony Pulis last week urged the game to embrace technology and permit each team two appeals against decisions in each match. He wrote in West Brom's programme for the match against Stoke: 'A TV call back should be brought in where for 30 seconds the game could be held up whilst they decide if the original decision was correct or not. Two calls allowed during the game from both sides would be sufficient and I believe would help improve the great package that the Barclays Premier League provides for everybody all over the world.'", "label": 0.3579545486718416, "predicted": 0.5357523560523987}, "282": {"text": "A kidnapped journalist who survived  Jihadi John has told of the blood-chilling moment the British extremist ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck in a mock execution at an ISIS prison. Javier Espinosa, a Spaniard captured alongside colleagues while reporting the conflict between President Assad's regime and militant soldiers in 2013, was freed last year after a deal was brokered between his government and front-line extremists. He had spent months at the mercy of Mohammed Emwazi, the British hooded executioner now ominously referred to as Jihadi John, and other terrorists while in captivity. Scroll down for video . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in the captivity of ISIS terrorists . Now, a year after his emotional reunion with his children on the tarmac of a Spanish airport, the correspondent has revealed the depths of horror he and dozens of other hostages faced daily. In an harrowing account printed by the Sunday Times, he relives the moment Emwazi, now the world's most wanted man, ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck, threatening execution. 'He caressed my neck with the blade but kept talking: \"Feel it? Cold, isn't it? Can you imagine the pain you'll feel when it cuts? Unimaginable pain,\"' Mr Espinosa wrote. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Emwazi, who 'wanted maximum drama', was among 'psychotic' extremists who pillaged the Spaniard's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Mr Espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova when the pair were working near the Turkish border in 2013. Mr Espinosa and his colleague Ricardo\u00a0Garcia Vilanova were kept alongside other hostages for months . Emwazi (right before joining extremists in Syria and left in his trademark hood) was among Mr Espinosa's captors . Alongside American journalists and aid workers including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, they were locked in ISIS prisons - as Mr Espinosa describes them 'elegant mansions' and the former government headquarters in Raqqa - across the war-ravaged country for months. While their comrades have all but been murdered - John Cantlie is seemingly still alive but in the group's clutches - the two Spaniards were freed, spared to tell the world of the group's atrocities. Among the most horrifying anecdotes was a threat to exhume the body of murdered Russian engineer\u00a0Sergei Gorbunov and make remaining hostages sleep next to his bullet-riddled head. 'They liked scaring their captives, forcing us to look at photos of Sergei Gorbanov...\"You might end up with him,' recalled Mr Espinosa. '\"We'll make you dig him up and put you in another tomb where you can sleep with him.\"' Being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace. On one occasion, the Spaniard notes, a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive Sharia law. The European and American hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved, Mr Espinosa claims to have been told. Instead they were being picked off one by own, their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos. While the journalist doesn't describe in depth any hopes he had of escaping, he revealed that asking his captors how to pray was among his first actions once taken. In March last year Mr Espinosa, a veteran journalist for the Spanish national newspaper El Mundo, and Mr Vilanova were taken into the care of Turkish authorities after six months of captivity. Once across the border he contacted his newspaper and his wife who later tweeted: 'Pure happiness'. To secure his release the Spanish government is understood to have paid a sum to the terror group. France, Italy, and Germany are other countries to have complied with extremists demands to ensure the release of kidnapped citizens. Britain and the U.S. are the only two to have stayed true to a UN agreement not to give in to such requests. As a result, jihadis claim, a handful of journalists and aid workers from both countries have been slaughtered. His first victim: American journalist James Foley was the first Western citizen to have been killed on film by Jihadi John in a sickening propaganda video . Slaughtered: Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines (right) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by the group . Mohammed Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John . The son of a Kuwaiti minicab driver, young Emwazi arrived in Britain speaking only a few words of English, and appeared more interested in football than in Islam. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. After finishing primary school in 1999, young Mohammed moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John\u2019s Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos. Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab. The university has since been linked with several proponents of radical Islam, and Emwazi appeared to have fallen under their sway. He began attending different mosques and was known to associate with Bilal el-Berjawi, who was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago. In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania in East Africa with friends and told authorities they were going on a wildlife safari. But the group was refused entry and put on a plane to the Netherlands, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent called Nick. The British officer accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab, he said, and said MI5 had been watching him. Emwazi denied the accusation \u2013 bragging that he would not take a designer Rocawear sweater in his luggage if he was planning to join Somalian rebels. In emails to the campaign group Cage, Emwazi said: \u2018He [Nick] knew everything about me; where I lived, what I did, the people I hanged around with.\u2019 \u2018Nick\u2019 then tried to recruit the 21-year-old, Emwazi claimed, and threatened him when he refused to cooperate. Emwazi said the officer told him: \u2018You\u2019re going to have a lot of trouble\u2026You\u2019re going to be known\u2026You\u2019re going to be followed\u2026Life will be harder for you.\u2019 On his return to Britain, Emwazi said his family told him they had been \u2018visited\u2019, and he claimed a woman he had been planning to marry broke off their engagement because her family had also been contacted and were scared. According to Emwazi, his family then began planning for him to travel to Kuwait to get him away from the \u2018harassment\u2019 he had suffered in Britain and he went to work for a computer programming company in the emirate. In 2013 after changing his name by deed poll he made another attempt to enter Kuwait but was rejected. Disappearing from home he was not seen again until appearing in ISIS propaganda films, his face masked as he slit the throats of innocents. His identity was revealed last month.

Archaeologists believe the elderly woman, whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix, may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last Plantagenet king of England. Her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in Leicester city centre on what was the site of the Grey Friars church, just feet from Richard III's grave. Scroll down for videos . The lead coffin, inlaid with a crucifix (top) was found just feet from the remains of Richard III. Inside was the skeleton of a woman who is thought to have died in her 60s about 200 years before the Plantagenet king . She was one of nine women found to have been buried within the medieval complex around the hastily dug final resting place of Richard III. However, radiocarbon dating shows she may been buried not long after the church was first built 1250 - nearly two centuries before Richard III died. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king\u00a0was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the University of Leicester has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life, eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish. It is thought that she had died in her 60s. This suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar. This all suggests she had special significant to the Catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary, archaeologists leading the excavation believe. They have found clues that suggest one of the women buried there was highly revered. Records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded, more than 700 years ago, show that the Bishop of Lincoln offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a Franciscan Church in Leicester. Dated to 1250, it offered a month off the pains of purgatory for anyone who would say 'a Pater and a Ave for the soul of Emma, wife of John of Holt, whose body is buried in the Franciscan church in Leicester'. However, according to Mathew Morris, lead archaeologist at Leicester University and site director for the excavation, she is thought to be from Nevill Holt in Leicestershire. However, little more is known about Emma Holt, and it was likely none of women found buried under Grey Friars will ever be completely identified. He said: 'We don't know much more about her. We know she was buried around 1290 in the friary church, but we don't know her age at death, what she did for a living or what she looked like. The lead coffin was found inside a limestone\u00a0sarcophagus (above) under the choir of the Grey Friars church . Archaeologists had to carefully remove stone lid on top the coffin (above) in order to exhume the body . The lead coffin had been damaged by water around the feet (above) causing the skeleton to become damaged . 'We don't have any known descendants who can provide a DNA sample, so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we cannot link the two together. 'Unfortunately this skeleton will always remain anonymous.' The twisted and battled scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012. Subsequent DNA work has positively confirmed the skeleton as belonging to the Plantagenet king. He had been buried in a crudely dug grave within the church in 1485. Further excavations on the site in August 2013, however, revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman. A further eight graves containing women were found around the spot where Richard III had been buried. Scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old Grey Friars church, which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of Richard III . The sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as Richard III but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin . Mr Morris said: 'What stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials \u2013 large, neatly dug graves with coffins \u2013 and the crudeness of Richard III\u2019s grave. 'The more we examine it, the clearer it becomes how atypical Richard III\u2019s burial really was.' In total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of Grey Friars and left six undisturbed. Two graves, inside the choir, contained wooden coffins with a woman inside each aged between 40 and 50 years old. Radiocarbon dating shows that they probably died between 1270 and 1400, while osteological analysis of the bones show that one of the women had a congenital hip dislocation that would have forced her to walk with a crutch. The other woman was found to have lived a life of hard physical labour, regularly using her arms and legs to life heavy weights. The stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled (shown above) due to the weight of the lid . Mathew Morris (above) led the excavation, which was done by hand rather than using heavy lifting machinery . Archaeologists uncovered Medieval floor tiles during the excavation that they believe would have formed the floor of the friary under which the body of Richard III and the women found on the site were buried . Another skeleton, which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work, also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid-20s. However, it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists. It is the first to be found in Leicester in a modern excavation. Mr Morris said: 'The stone sarcophagus was a tapered box carved from a single block of limestone. Inside, the wider end was curved, creating a broad head niche. 'Unfortunately, the stone lid did not properly fit the coffin allowing water to get inside, and its immense weight had badly cracked the sarcophagus, meaning it could not be lifted intact. 'However, inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton\u2019s feet.' Initially the coffin was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary to be examined for an endoscope in case any tissue had been preserved. Mr Morris said that while the body had decayed to leave only a skeleton, fragments of cloth and hair were still intact. He said: 'Opening a lead coffin was an interesting experience. It is a little like opening a tin can. There were a few fragments of linen or cloth and cord - these might be the remains of the shroud. A little bit of hair survived as well. 'A grave like this you have go to think this person was important to the friars. We know this woman was over 60 when she died. Stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat. 'When you compare her diet with Richard III it is only just below his adult diet.'", "label": 0.2272727321833372, "predicted": 0.5979815721511841}, "284": {"text": "A brave young son saved his mother and risked his own safety as he protected her from three masked attackers.

'It's the most important goal I have scored for the club so far,' he said. 'And of course it means even more because of who it was against.

But he added: 'There is still a long way to go and we know it will be difficult. We have to make the most of the advantage we now have. But we know we can't relax especially against a rival as strong as Madrid.' Jubilant Barca coach Luis Enrique praised Suarez saying: \u2018He finished the goal like very few players can. He is a striker who can score goals like this, but he is also technical enough to play the football we play and physical enough to compliment the other players in the side. We signed him for nights like this.\u2019 The game looked to be slipping away from Barcelona after they were made to suffer in the first half. Luis Enrique admitted: \u2018The goal calmed us down a lot in the second half. It\u2019s a big a win against our eternal rival but we have a lot of difficult games to go before the league is won. 'The win means more because this is a very good Madrid side.\u2019 Until Suarez struck the night had belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo, who responded to a week of global adulation for Lionel Messi by equalising in the first half to silence the Camp Nou after Jeremy Mathieu opened the scoring. Ronaldo\u2019s every touch was booed \u2014 even from his first run down the left inside 60 seconds. It only took Messi 10 minutes to mark up his first nutmeg, sending the ball through Toni Kroos\u2019 legs, but it was Real with a pumped-up Ronaldo who made much of the early running and he hit the bar from Karim Benzema\u2019s cross. At the other end, Pepe and Suarez clashed and Barcelona were awarded a free-kick. Messi took it and, powering in ahead of Ramos, Mathieu headed past Casillas for his first Barcelona goal. The hosts should have doubled their lead but Neymar made a mess of a Suarez assist and they paid the price as Real Madrid scored with their next attack. Luka Modric played the ball to Karim Benzema, the Frenchman\u2019s flick found Ronaldo in space and he swept the ball past Claudio Bravo.

Suarez had been quiet since his booking in the first half but, when Alves played him through with a brilliant first touch, he controlled the ball inside the area and rifled into the far corner.

Suarez could also have scored again wriggling away from Dani Carvajal only to pull his shot wide. Real Madrid kept going forward and as with the very first chance of the second period Benzema was denied by Bravo. Jordi Alba then steamed through on to a Messi pass only for the ball to be cleared for a corner. From the kick Suarez sent a shot high over Casillas\u2019 bar.

Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize . or know Williams as a protester. 'He never protested before,' Bishop Derrick Robinson, an activist, told CNN on Monday. The shooting of the officers, who were treated at a local . hospital and released, followed a flurry of resignations and . protests in the week after the U.S. Justice Department released . a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing. Wounded: In the shooting early on Thursday, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound. Another officer, 32, suffered a facial wound. Above, one of the officers  is seen being taken away by EMT . Shooting: Police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the Ferguson Police Station last Thursday . St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said he believed the 20-year-old suspect attended last week's protest before the shooting happened. Activists said Williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight-knit group. 'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' McCulloch said of Williams' contention that he did not fire at the officers. Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and the case was scheduled for a later date. Court officials said he did not yet have an attorney. Williams' arrest came as anti-police protesters (pictured) have resumed demonstrations outside Ferguson police station . McCulloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with Williams and that the investigation is ongoing. Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said. He also said tips from the public led to the arrest. Williams is being held on $300,000 bond. Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters, who also had not heard of him. Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement. 'This is a fear tactic,' she said. 'We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.' John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, 'I don't know him. I've never seen him.'

Brent Pogue, the collection contains coins from the early years of the American republic, from 1792 to the 1830s. These are the most sought-after U.S. coins in existence, as the crude production techniques of the period meant that the coins were fragile, making surviving high-quality examples are extremely rare.

Brent, this is considered the most valuable collection of federal American coins dating from the 1790s to the late 1830s in private hands. An 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three known to exist, and an 1804 Silver Dollar dubbed the 'King of American Coins' are expected to be among the top lots when the collection is sold in a series of auctions in New York beginning in May and continuing into 2017. 'These two coins in particular, we think, have a possibility of being up around that $10 million mark,' said Brian Kendrella, the president of Stack's Bowers Galleries. The rare coin and currency auctioneer, which is handling the sales with Sotheby's, believes the coins could shatter the $10 million record set in 2013 for a 1794 Silver Dollar. The Pogue collection includes two examples of the coveted 1804 silver dollar, considered to be the most famous coin in America, which is known as 'the pinnacle of coin collecting'. One of these is valued at $9.8million (\u00a36.7million). Notably, it was\u00a0presented to the Sultan of Muscat in 1835. D. Brent Pogue, from Dallas, Texas, has now decided to 'cash in his cash' by auctioning off more than 650 individual coins at a number of Sotheby's and Stack's Bowers Galleries sales over the next two years. Experts expect the collection to sell for almost $220million (\u00a3150million), more than any other series of rare coins. On Friday, Sotheby's showed off the jaw-dropping collection at its saleroom in New Bond Street, London. David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, said: 'To have the world's most valuable private coin collection available for viewing and sale in our galleries is a huge privilege and a great responsibility. 'Sotheby's and Stacks Bowers have worked fruitfully together in the past, notably on the sales of the 1933 Gold Double Eagle for $7.6 million and the Dallas Bank Collection. 'The D. Brent Pogue Collection will be a thrilling addition to that auction history.' A highlight of the collection is a $5 gold piece, known as the 1822 Gold Eagle, which is thought to be one of three in existence, and the only one in private hands. Considered the most desirable US gold coin outside of public collections, it is expected to sell for around $8.8million (\u00a36 million). The 1797 Half Dollar, considered the most beautiful and best-preserved example of a design used for only two years, is the most valuable half dollar in existence. It is anticipated to sell for $1.5million (\u00a31million). And the 1808 Quarter Eagle, which is a $2.50 coin, is also expected to sell for around $1.5million (\u00a31million), which is 500,000 times its face value.The coin was previously owned by the Maryland banker Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr, and the early 20th Century beer magnate Virgil M. Brand, according to Catholic Online. Half Eagle coins have been widely collected over the years by notable figures including the banker J.P. Morgan. Handle with care: A Sotheby's employee holds a selection of American coins including a 1822 Half Eagle, or Five Dollar Gold Piece, and an 1804 silver dollar, both estimated to be worth between $8 and $10 million.

Brent Pogue, who assembled the collection with his father, described selling his collection as 'bittersweet' Most of the coins were made during a time when small mintages and crude production facilities at the Philadelphia Mint made the survival of any high-quality coins unlikely. Each steel die used to strike coins in the early 1800s was painstakingly produced by hand, creating variations that are prized by collectors. The first sale, by Sotheby's and Stack's Bowers Galleries, will be on 19 May and there will be six further auctions with the final sale in May 2017. D. Brent Pogue, who assembled the collection with the help of his property developer father, described the sale as 'bittersweet'. He said: 'I feel now is the time to pass the torch to a new generation of custodians, who can appreciate the legacy of these great American coins. 'These coins conjure up many fond memories, and I hope the new owners will enjoy them as much as I have.' Coin sales are driven by the economy, but\u00a0Brian Kendrella, the president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, said investors and collectors are also lured by the rarity, uniqueness, condition and historical significance of coins. 'They are artefacts that speak to what was going on in the United States at the time these coins were made,' he said. 'That's one of the main draws.' Perfection: This 1795 Eagle ten dollar gold piece (left and right) is one of the most perfectly preserved 18th Century U.S. gold coins in the world . In awe:\u00a0A Sotheby's employee holds an American 1804 silver dollar, estimated to be worth between $8 and $10million, which is part of the famous Pogue coin collection, the most valuable private collection of coins in the world, that is currently being auctioned off in sections . With a dozen coins selling for $1 million or more in 2014, and the first gold coin struck for the United States fetching $4.5 million, the nonprofit Professional Numismatists Guild estimates the overall U.S. rare coin market to be worth about $5 billion. Walter Husak, a retired aerospace entrepreneur based in California, knows just how lucrative it can be. A collection of 301 rare penny coins dating from 1793 to 1814, which he gathered over more than 13 years, sold in 2008 for $10.7 million - about double what he invested in it. 'I never thought it would go up that much,' he said. 'There are a lot of people getting involved in coins.' Barry Stuppler, secretary of the Professional Numismatists Guild, has seen plenty of changes in his 52 years in the coin business. He says that the market has been booming in recent years. 'It is a combination of the economy coming back,' he said, 'and the fact that interest rates are very low.' The internet, he said, also has been 'a tremendous, tremendous source of new buyers and sellers of coins that we didn't have 20 years ago.' Demand for rare, investment-quality coins, graded and certified by the guild and the Florida-based Numismatic Guaranty Corporation, is high and supply is low. 'The rarities do the best, particularly gold and silver coins,' said Stuppler. 'The Pogue Collection is extraordinary.' Enticing:\u00a0Two stars of the collection.

But BBC News has spoken to a former senior employee of the OPCW, who has given his assessment of the likely details and timetable of the testing process.\nDr Ralf Trapp said that samples from Syria gathered by inspectors had arrived at the OPCW central laboratory on Saturday and would be arriving at \"designated laboratories\" across the world around now for analysis. The results will form part of a report by the OPCW due to be published by the UN on the alleged attack. He told BBC News that the report would take between seven to 10 days to complete at the earliest.\nThe report should contain strong scientific evidence to help establish whether chemical weapons were involved in the alleged attack last in the agricultural belt Ghouta around the Syrian capital Damascus. It could also possibly indicate the type of delivery systems to have been used, according to Dr Trapp.\n\"There may be details of the concentrations of the agent used and whether these weapons were improvised or designed for a military context,\" he said.\nThe purpose of the UN/OPCW report is to establish the facts of what happened rather than find the culprit. However, according to Dr Trapp, these facts should give an indication of the source. It will also help answer why, in his opinion, many of the victims did not display the typical symptoms of sarin exposure, such as the narrowing of pupils (known as pinball eyes) and shaking, in video clips uploaded shortly after the alleged attack.\n\"I'm pretty sure it was a chemical attack, but I'm not 100% sure it was sarin, or sarin of bad quality, another agent, or a mixture of things. All these things make sense in the context of what we have seen (in the videos),\" he explained.\nLast week OPCW and UN investigators were gathering soil, blood, urine and hair from the alleged victims of the attack and tissue samples from corpses. They have also been wiping possible chemical residues from the inside of shell fragments.\nThere had been concern that few, if any, traces of nerve agent would be detected following the two days it took for UN inspectors to arrive at the site of the alleged attack. But according to Dr Trapp, evidence of these agents would remain for many weeks.\nThe samples have been tagged, photographed and transported to OPCW's central laboratory in sealed containers. The testing procedures involve numerous checks and cross checks to ensure that there is no mix up in the samples and the results are accurate.\nEach sample is sent to three separate laboratories that the organisation has inspected and deemed competent to carry out the testing on its behalf. If there are many samples to analyse, they are sent to other laboratories. Individual labs conduct their own independent tests of the material.\nFor each sample from the site of the alleged attack, a given laboratory receives two dummy samples; one containing no nerve agent and another containing a specified amount of a nerve agent or its breakdown product. The lab is not told which sample is which, enabling the OPCW to ensure that each lab does its job properly.\nIn addition, a lab has to test each sample using two completely different methods - and then, as a triple check to verify the accuracy of the instruments they are using, manufacture the agent it thinks it has detected and run the test again to see if they obtain the same result.\nThis painstaking process will take the scientists several days to complete, after which the lead investigator will have to write up a report which is then sent back to the OPCW.\nThese results are combined with interviews, assessments of medical reports by inspectors.\nThe time all this will take depends on the number of samples that have to be analysed and the number of labs involved in the testing.\nDr Trapp believes that mid to late next week will be the very earliest that the UN could receive the completed report although Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will be receiving regular updates in the interim.\nOne of the testing sites on the OPCW's list of \"designated laboratories\" is the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down in Wiltshire, which is internationally respected for its research capability in this area. The network of more than 20 laboratories also includes facilities in China, the US and France.\nThe laboratories undertaking the work will have been selected by the OPCW's director-general Mr Ahmet Uzumcu, no doubt in consultation with Mr Ban.

We get filthy water and empty aquifers and huge insurance premiums and ruined carpets. And all of it at public expense,\" Mr Monbiot wrote earlier this month.\nThe idea of catching water upstream is strongly supported by the water and environment professional body, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM).\nIts spokesman Katherine Pygott has previously told BBC News: \"Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy.\n\"Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country - but it is complicated, with many different organisations involved, and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven't seen that leadership.\"\nEnvironment Secretary Owen Paterson told me he would give serious consideration to innovative solutions to flooding, like rewilding.\nThe government could theoretically encourage farmers to rewild key parts of their catchments using grants under the Common Agricultural Policy, but CIWEM say that at the moment it is much easier for farmers to get grants for wildlife protection than flood protection.\nMr Paterson had hoped to divert more cash into a fund that could be used for these sort of measures but was overruled by the prime minister after a campaign by farmers demanding to keep the maximum amount of their grants into direct payments for farming - in effect, for owning land.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "label": 0.34375, "predicted": 0.13420361280441284}, "298": {"text": "The proposal, from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, calls on Switzerland to abandon its free movement of people treaty with the European Union and introduce strict quotas on immigration.\nSwitzerland is not a member of the EU, but has adopted large sections of EU policy, including free movement and the Schengen open-borders agreement, in order to have access to Europe's single market.\nBrussels has always insisted that the Swiss will not be allowed to cherry-pick only the aspects of EU policy they like.\nBut its successful economy, and soaring unemployment in many eurozone countries, make Switzerland a very attractive destination.\nIn 2013, 80,000 immigrants joined Switzerland's population of eight million.

Swiss business leaders are anxious too.\nJens Atteslander, an economist with the Swiss Business Federation, points out that Brussels has made it very clear that although Switzerland is not in the EU, it cannot simply abandon aspects of EU policy which are unpopular with its citizens, such as free movement, and keep the popular ones, such as access to Europe's single market.\n\"Integration into the single market is absolutely crucial to our economy,\" he explains. \"Over 55% of all our exports go directly to the European single market. We import over 80% from that market.\n\"We got very clear statements from Brussels. They tell us: 'Listen, this is the fundamental principle of the single market, those who do not comply with it do not have access or integration into the single market.' We are here in a closed neighbourhood, we are in the heart of western Europe, so there is no alternative.\"\nThe latest opinion polls show the referendum on free movement is likely to be very close. Despite the very real economic concerns, despite the fact that unemployment in Switzerland is just 3% and that sectors such as the health service (over a third of staff in Swiss hospitals are foreign) depend on workers from the EU, many voters are swayed by the argument that Switzerland just cannot take any more people.\nA yes to free movement will mean an open door to EU workers.\nA yes to quotas could have potentially disastrous consequences for the Swiss economy.

As a result, the JACC can advise that no signs of aircraft debris have been found by the autonomous underwater vehicle since it joined the search effort.\n\"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgement, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370.\"\nAustralia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search had been based on \"the best information available at the time\".\nThe statement came hours after a US Navy official told CNN that the acoustic signals probably came from some other man-made source.\nThe failure of the autonomous sub Bluefin-21 to find any wreckage in the ping search zone is a hammer blow to the families. It's also a sharp reminder to everyone of just how difficult this whole exercise will be.\nWere the pings real or were they simply spurious, a misinterpretation of sound in what is already a very noisy environment? The investigating teams will review again all their data. They will not jump to immediate conclusions. The water column can do strange things with sound, sending it in unexpected directions. The teams will be mindful also that the Bluefin-21 was at times operating beyond its qualified limits.\nThe authorities have now recognised the need to make a proper bathymetric (depth) survey of the wider search zone - some 60,000 sq km in area.\nIt will take at least three months, but once they know precisely the shape and depth of the sea bed they can then better choose the most appropriate vehicles to continue the underwater sweep. Wreckage could be in a ravine, covered by shifted sediment.  Without the right tools, the job of finding MH370 will be that much harder.\n\"Our best theory at this point is that [the pings were] likely some sound produced by the ship... or within the electronics of the towed pinger locator,\" Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, told the US broadcaster.\n\"Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound,\" Mr Dean said.\nA US Navy spokesmen subsequently described his comments as \"speculative and premature\".\nIn its statement, JACC said an expert working group would continue to review and refine existing data to better define a search area for the missing plane.\nA Chinese ship had already begun mapping an area of ocean floor in a survey process that was expected to take three months.\nMeanwhile, the ATSB would soon seek bids from commercial contractors for the specialist equipment needed for the underwater search - a process expected to begin in August, JACC said.", "label": 0.45000001043081284, "predicted": 0.4852079153060913}, "301": {"text": "With more than half the votes counted, President Juan Manuel Santos is leading his conservative rival Oscar Ivan Zaluaga with slightly more than 50%.\nThe campaign has been dominated by discussions on the ongoing peace talks with the leftist Farc rebel group.\nMr Santos, who launched negotiations in November 2012, lost the first round last month by a narrow margin.\nMr Zuluaga says he will impose tougher conditions in order to carry on with the talks.\nMore than 32 million Colombians were eligible to vote, but the turnout was low in the first round at just over 40%.\nMr Zuluaga, 55, is a former finance minister.

We don't put enough big scores on the board.\"\n\"The umpires feel more comfortable being able to report them in privacy rather than having to call them in a match. The Laws of the game are held by MCC, from Test cricket to school cricket.

Many of us don't agree with it but we live by it because that's the rules.\n\"I have always believed to bowl the doosra you have to bend and straighten your arm - that's throwing. Now they have legalised throwing up to 15 degrees. You can tell as a cricketer when somebody has a funny action, but the ICC has chosen at international level to have some boffins in a studio with lights and camera and all kinds of mechanics to say he bends and straightens it - which is really a euphemism for throwing - 10 degrees, so he's alright.\"\n\"Last time in England it was pretty close, it should have been 2-2.

Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt?\nThe answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics.\nThe pace of political change has certainly slowed.  In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency.\nIn the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army.\nPolitical prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations.\nIn a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible.\nStories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events.\nBut the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could.\nSo did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge.\nMs Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged.\nDrafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution.\nThis is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\".\nThe opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most.\nThey are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes.\nMuch of Ms Suu Kyi's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition.\nJust as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees.\nWith each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results.\nAltering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there's no way it can be changed.\nMs Suu Kyi's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders.\nLooming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president?\nThough the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that's not to say there haven't been other important developments.  It's just that they don't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi.\nEver since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state.\nThe last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future.\nFor President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what's likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more.\nOutside politics, particularly in the big cities, people's lives are changing fast.\nThanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind.\nOn Myanmar's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market.\nAfter years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that's a game-changer.\nSo is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?

Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made.\nWhat this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party.\nThe so-called \"ransoms\" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey.\nTake a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys.\nThey are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp.\nStina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into.\nIf you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers.\nThe migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like.\nMeanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid.\nThe model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier.\nIt seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand.\nBut other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty.\nWe were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (\u00c2\u00a3260/$400) back to his family each month.\nBut many, many migrants don't make it.\nWithin minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters).\nSome said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them.

Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\nIt's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\nAyatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.\nArrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.\nExiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.\nIn January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.\nThere was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.\nIslamic law was introduced across the country.\nThe new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\".\nThe big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.\nYears of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.\nI spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.\nShe told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.\n\"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\"\nWhich brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?\nIt could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.\nProfessor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.\n\"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.\n\"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.\n\"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.\n\"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\"\nBut Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.\nAnd Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.\n\"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well.

Americans increasingly think that other countries should share the burden.\nObama, while continuing to trumpet \"American exceptionalism\", regularly prefaces remarks on foreign affairs by acknowledging the limits of US power, again with little public outcry.\nThe upshot is that the United States is no longer so keen to exert leadership in an increasingly messy world.\nYet one of the reasons why the world has become so disorderly is because America is no longer so active in imposing order.\nOver the course of this century Washington has lost its fear factor.\nWorld leaders nowadays seem prepared to provoke the wrath of the White House, confident that it will never rain down on them.\nIt explains why the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after unleashing chemical weapons against his people, continues to bombard them with barrel bombs.\nWhy Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, and also offered a safe haven for the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nAnd also why Benjamin Netanyahu thumbed his nose at the Obama administration, by accepting an invitation from the Republican congressional leadership to address a joint session of Congress, a platform he used to lambast the Iran nuclear deal.\nAssad's flouting of American warnings is especially noteworthy.\nIn killing so many civilians with chemical weapons, he flagrantly crossed the \"red line\" imposed by Obama, but escaped punishment.\nThe president was unwilling to carry through on an explicit threat, in what was the biggest foreign policy climbdown of his presidency and also one of the most significant in the past 50 years.\nEven supporters of Barack Obama believe he made a fatal strategic mistake, because it demonstrated endless flexibility and a lack of American resolve.\nNeedless to say, despots around the world took note.\nAmerica's reluctance to launch new military actions has also had a major bearing on the nuclear negotiations with Iran.\nTehran has managed to extract notable concessions, such as the ongoing ability to enrich uranium, hitherto ruled out by the Americans.\nIt has played a weak hand strongly, because it knows that America has what the foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman calls \"an empty holster\".\nNor is it just America's enemies who no longer fear the White House to the extent they once did.\nIn recent months, two close allies, Britain and Australia, have defied the Obama administration by joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nBy signing up to the AIIB, they are effectively endorsing Beijing's effort to establish financial rivals to the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are dominated by America.\nBy seeking improved commercial and diplomatic relations with China, Britain and Australia are also hedging.\nThey suspect that America will not be the dominant Pacific military power indefinitely, nor the world's foremost economic powerhouse.\nOther American allies would complain that the \"dependability factor\" has also gone.\nIsrael feels badly let down by the Obama administration over the Iran deal, and relations between Benjamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama are poisonous.\nThe president, by using deliberately ambiguous language, has even signalled that his administration might end its traditional protection of Israel at the United Nations.\nLike Israel, Saudi Arabia has been enraged by the prospective nuclear deal with the Iranians.\nRiyadh also knows that America is no longer so dependent on its oil, the cornerstone of the relationship since the end of World War Two.\nEgypt was angered in 2012 when Obama said Cairo was neither an ally nor an enemy.\nLater, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction, and reinstated Cairo as a \"major non-Nato ally.\"\nMaybe Obama's Egyptian error, and the slight it conveyed, was truly a Freudian slip.\nAfter all, he hasn't invested the same energy nurturing alliances as his predecessors. The detached air that has been a hallmark of his presidency also extends to foreign affairs.\nHere, I gather, Obama recognises intellectually that he could do far more in terms of massaging the egos of world leaders, but cannot quite bring himself to do so.\nIndeed, a common complaint is that the Obama administration has prioritised normalising relations with its one-time enemies, Iran and Cuba, at the expense of fostering longstanding friendships.\nRealising that America is no longer so supportive, and no longer so engaged in the Middle East, the Saudis have recently taken military action of their own in Yemen.\nThere's also been a warming of relations between Riyadh and Moscow.\nAnd Egypt launched airstrikes in February against the Islamic State group in Libya.\nAmerica's standing in the Middle East has unquestionably waned, along with its ability to shape events.\nMore surprising has been its slippage in Africa, Obama's ancestral home, and Asia, the focus of his much vaunted pivot.\nIn Asia, America's median approval rating in 2014, as measured by Gallup, was 39%, a 6% drop since 2011.\nIn Africa, the median approval went down to 59%, the lowest since polling began, despite Obama hosting the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington in August, last year.\nIt even dropped in Kenya, his father's birthplace.\nAmerica's diplomacy has also been complicated by the dysfunction and hyper-partisanship in Washington.\nRepublican lawmakers actively sought to derail the Iran nuclear deal by sending a letter to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nHouse speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress, knowing it would infuriate the White House.\nDemocrats with reservations about free trade have tried to sabotage the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal since Nafta.\nThere's also been strong congressional opposition to one of the big plays of Obama's second term, the rapprochement with Cuba.\nShould countries listen to the president or Congress?\nAmerica cannot even lay claim any more to its great, uncontested boast since 1872, of being the world's largest economy.\nThe IMF now estimates that China's economy is fractionally bigger.\nYet it would be a mistake to exaggerate the downsizing of American influence.\nUS military spending continues to dwarf its rivals, and up until last year amounted to more than the next 10 countries combined.\nIn 2014, America spent $731bn, compared to China's $143bn.\nEven though China's economy is now larger, America's per capita spending power is in a different league - $53,000 to $11,868.\nThough America is contending with the rise of the rest - China, India, Brazil, Germany and Russia - it has not yet been overtaken by emergent rivals.\nIndeed, there are foreign policy thinkers here who predict that America will preserve its pre-eminence for at least another 20 years.\nYet the unipolar moment ushered in by the fall of the Berlin Wall has proved to be just that: momentary.\nMoreover, hopes of a new world order following the collapse of the Soviet Union have given way to widespread pessimism about the spread, even the contagion, of global disorder.\nGone are the certainties of America's Cold War thinking, when the containment of communism governed its international actions.\nGone are the doctrines that gave US foreign policy such a rigid frame, throughout the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11.\nGone, too, is the notion that every fight is an American fight and along with it a redefinition of what constitutes the US national interest.\nBarack Obama has instead advocated pragmatism and diplomatic dexterity, trying to steer a path between America being overextended and undercommitted.\nMaybe the overriding challenge for US diplomacy over the next 20 years is to strike the proper balance.", "label": 0.0, "predicted": 0.01588960736989975}, "322": {"text": "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.\nMission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.\nSuch worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.\nNasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home.\nIt is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.\nJon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\"\nThe new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.\nDetermining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.\nKepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.\nThe mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.\nThe new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.\nTwelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.\nThis zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.\nOf these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.\nDr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.\n\"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.\n\"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\"\nWhile similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.\n\"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\n\"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\n\"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\"\nDr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\n\"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.\n\"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\"\nDr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.\n\"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\"\nHe added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\n\"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\"\nThe findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "label": 0.0, "predicted": 0.41666290163993835}, "323": {"text": "Mani Dad was living with his Polish mother Leyla Dad in Kielce, Poland, when he disappeared early this year.\nHe is thought to be in the UK with his British father, property dealer Zayn Dean, 47, also known as Dholtana Dad.\nMs Dad, 33, said Costa coffee shops were among Mani's favourite haunts and asked customers to look out for him.\nMs Dad, who has launched family court proceedings in a bid to find her son, said she had spoken to Mani by telephone several times and he told her he had visited Costa with his father.\n\"He loves Costa.

Yet each can trace its history back to the same starting point - a fertilised egg.\nDevelopmental biology is the business of unravelling how the genetic code unfolds at each cycle of cell division, how the body plan develops, and how tissues become specialised. But much of what it has revealed has depended on inference rather than a complete cell-by-cell history.\n\"I actually started working on this problem as a graduate student in 2000,\" confessed Jay Shendure, lead researcher on the new scientific paper.\n\"Could we find a way to record these relationships between cells in some compact form we could later read out in adult organisms?\"\nThe project failed then because there was no mechanism to record events in a cell's history.\nThat changed with recent developments in so called CRISPR gene editing, a technique that allows researchers to make much more precise alterations to the DNA in living organisms.\nThe molecular tape recorder developed by Prof Shendure's team at the University of Washington in Seattle, US, is a length of DNA inserted into the genome that contains a series of edit points which can be changed throughout an organism's life.\nEach edit records a permanent mark on the tape that is inherited by all of a cell's descendants. By examining the number and pattern of all these marks in an adult cell, the team can work back to find its origins.\nDevelopmental biologist James Briscoe of the Crick Institute, in London, UK, calls it \"a creative and exciting use\" of the CRISPR technique.\n\"It uniquely and indelibly marks cells with a 'barcode' that is inherited in the DNA. This means you can use the barcode to trace all the progeny of barcoded cells,\" he said.\nJay Shendure collaborated with molecular biologist Alex Schier of Harvard University to prove the technique on a classic lab organism - the zebrafish.\nNot only did they show the technique works, they could trace the lineage of hundreds of thousands of cells in mature fish. They also showed it has the power to change perceptions about biological development.\n\"We can look at individual organs - say the left eye or the right eye, or the gills or the heart,\" Prof Shendure explained in an interview with the BBC's Science in Action radio programme, \"and the real surprise was that in every organ we looked at, the majority of the organ came from just a handful of progenitor cells.\"\nFor example, although they identified over a thousand cell lineages within one of their fish, it took only five of them to create most of the blood cells. The surprise is evident in the published paper, which includes a few suggested explanations. James Briscoe also finds the discovery remarkable.\n\"It's striking that a barcode found in one organ was rarely found in another,\" he wrote in an e-mail, adding that in the early embryo, cells are often mobile and so a richer mix could be expected. An unexpectedly small group of \"founder cells\" would be one explanation.\nOr \"there could be many founding cells, from different lineages (barcodes), at early embryonic stages, but many of these lineages die off as the tissue develops.\"\nFurther experiments with the technique could unwrap the details. But the fact that a simple, profound question was immediately thrown up by the new technique shows just how powerful it is.\nAnd the technique does not have to be limited to healthy development.\n\"Cancers develop by a lineage, too,\" Alex Schier told the BBC. \"Our technique can be used to follow these lineages during cancer formation - to tell us the relationships of cells within a tumour, and between the original tumour and secondary tumours formed by metastasis.\"\nAnd Prof Shendure points out that many inherited diseases develop because of faulty genetic programming.\n\"Many of these may well have their basis in the skewing of the cell lineage,\" he explained.\nThe technique comes with the somewhat tortured acronym GESTALT - the German for \"shape\". It is easy to use, and could easily be improved, says Jay Shendure.

by powers over foreign affairs being reserved to Westminster.\nHe was speaking as the UK's highest court heard a second day of argument in the historic Brexit legal challenge.\nThe Scottish

Potentially there could be further votes on issues like the Brexit implications for Northern Ireland.\nThe expectation is that the amended bill will get its Third Reading on Tuesday evening....but the ritual of Parliamentary ping-pong, where the Bill then bounces between the Lords and Commons until its final form can be agreed, will have to be postponed for a while.\nThe opportunity for the Commons to accept or - more likely - reject the changes made by peers will be blocked by the debate on the Budget, which will occupy the Commons into the following week.\nSo there will be a week or more for the pressure to build on MPs before they vote on the issue - and during the interval the Commons Brexit Select Committee will publish a report on the rights of UK and EU citizens (on Sunday) in good time to influence the vote.\nIt's a sign of the times that Brexit could eclipse what's normally a highlight of the Parliamentary year, but there will be plenty to watch out for in what will be the last full-scale budget in March. Next year it will be downgraded to a mere \"Spring Statement\" with the Budget moving to the autumn.\nFirst up the forecasts for government debt, with the Treasury continuing to seek further austerity savings across government. Second, whether there will be an injection of extra funds to defuse the row over business rates, and third, whether the government will put more money into adult social care, and maybe even signal a long term review of the system.\nThe Westminster buzz is that the public finances are in better shape than expected - but that any spare cash will be stashed away in a Brexit war chest, rather than spent now.\nElsewhere, there's important action on the Children and Social Work Bill, where the government has delighted cross-party campaigners by bringing forward amendments to make relationship educations (emphatically not sex education) compulsory at primary school level.\nCross-party pressure from family values campaigners like the influential Conservative backbencher, David Burrowes, and supporters of extended sex education like the Women and Equalities Committee Chair, Maria Miller, and Labour's Sarah Champion, appears to have secured its goal.\nBoth groups were persuaded that a new approach was needed to tackle the problem of sexting and sexual harassment in schools.\nAnd the government may also be tested on a couple of issues on the Higher Education Bill, where there are two days of Report Stage consideration in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens at 14.30 BST with Home Office Questions - and then watch out for any ministerial statements or urgent questions at 3.30.\nIn particular, the Culture Secretary Karen Bradley is expected to update MPs on the proposed merger between Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has now been formally notified to the European Commission.\nAn earlier attempt at this was withdrawn during the 2010 Parliament, in the wake of the hacking scandal, and the issue remains highly sensitive.\nShe must decide by 17 March 17 whether to ask the regulator, Ofcom, to carry out a public interest test.\nThen MPs move on to the Second Reading debate of the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill - this aims, among other things, to create a legal framework for insuring automated vehicles, because at the moment the law does not provide for them, require fuel retailers to provide charge points for electric cars, and create a new criminal offence of shining a laser at any means of transport.\nThere's also a separate draft bill to create a UK spaceport, which will go out for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Commons Science and Technology Committee.\nIn Westminster Hall at 16.30 GMT MPs debate e-petition 129823 which says that dress code laws should be changed so that women have the option to wear flat formal shoes at work, if they wish, arguing that \"current formal work dress codes are out-dated and sexist\".\nIn the Lords at 14.30 GMT the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by the first Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. Expect votes on tiered Higher Educational establishments - gold, silver, bronze universities.\nWatch out too for a short debate on recent legislation on assisted dying in North America; and whether those laws provide an appropriate basis for legislation in England and Wales, led by Labour's Baroness Jay of Paddington.\nThis suggests that the Lords assisted dying lobby have not entirely given up following the defeat of Rob Marris's bill in the Commons, last year.\nMPs begin at 11.30 GMT with Justice Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on the Queen's Sapphire Jubilee from the Conservative, Andrew Rosindell.\nThe day's main event is the Report stage of the Children and Social Work Bill (see above). The Conservative Sir Edward Leigh has fired in an amendment to the sex and relationship education proposals, to allow a parent to request that their child be wholly or partly excused.\nLabour MPs are also proposing new clauses to ensure that children in care are allowed reasonable contact with their siblings, and to revoke provisions in the Bill that enable local authorities in England and Wales to place children in secure accommodation in Scotland, and vice versa.\nThere are a battery of amendments on child safeguarding issues including a big cross-party amendment on requiring regular reports by local councils on their ability to provide proper safeguarding services for children.\nIn Westminster Hall, the debates are on: beer duty (9.30 GMT); the Coast to Coast Walk (11.00 GMT); the O'Neill review into antibiotic resistance (14.30 GMT); the sale of student loans (16.00 GMT) and social care in Liverpool (16.30 GMT).\nMy Committee pick is the Home Affairs session, with Rob Wainwright, the Director of Europol on policing and security issues across the EU and Britain's role, post-Brexit (14.15 GMT).\nThis is a key Brexit issue, and one where the Prime Minister has made clear her enthusiasm for continued British participation in Europol.\nIn the Lords, peers open for business at the earlier than usual time of 11.00 GMT to provide extra debating time for the Report Stage consideration of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill  - breaking off, briefly, at 14.30 GMT for their usual half an hour of questions to ministers.\nAfter the Report Stage, three hours of Brexit breathing space is provided while the amended version of the Bill is knocked into shape. During this interval there will be a 90 minute debate on the economic and environmental benefits of shale gas development in the UK, led by the former trade minister Lord Truscott.\nAnd then there may be an adjournment for a while, before peers can return to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, for the Third Reading debate. This is normally a rather sonorous formality, but may not be on this occasion....\nThe Commons opens at 11.30 GMT with Welsh Questions followed by Prime Minister's Questions at noon. And then it's onto the Budget (see above).\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates are on: financial support for apprentices (9.30 GMT); compensation and the Pandemrix vaccine (11 GMT); the proposed ban on microbeads (14.30 GMT); extension of the right to buy to tenants of housing associations in Bedford (16.00 GMT) and broadband speeds (16.30 GMT).\nIn the Lords at 16.00 GMT it's the second Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. There will also be a short debate on the UK's exports strategy.\nMPs open at 09.30 GMT with Exiting the European Union Questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House - before moving on to day two of the Budget debate.\nIn Westminster Hall, from 13.30 GMT, there's a debate on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee report on the Demography of Scotland and the implications for devolution.\nThis looks at the policy problems posed by the combination of Scotland's slower population growth, its ageing population and lower life expectancy, particularly for health and care services, potentially increasing the demands on NHS Scotland and Scottish social care services in the future.\nAt 15.00 GMT the subject is human rights and the political situation in Turkey.\nIn the Lords at 13.00 GMT, the main event is the Second Reading of the Criminal Finances Bill which aims to tackle money laundering, terrorist finance and corruption the UK and overseas, in the wake of the Panama papers revelations of industrial scale tax avoidance.\nThe National Crime Agency estimates that up to \u00c2\u00a390bn may be laundered in the UK each year. The Bill was criticised in the Commons for failing to include penalties for companies which permitted their staff to facilitate money laundering, or do more to reveal the beneficial owners of assets, or deal with the lack of corporate transparency in Britain's crown dependencies and overseas territories.\nThat is followed be a debate to mark International Women's Day.\nThe Lords meets at 10.00 GMT to debate the detail of a series of private members bills from the Commons. First up will be the Second Reading of the Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence Bill - which incorporates the Istanbul Convention into UK law.\nNext the Committee stage of the Homelessness Reduction Bill - which puts new obligations on local councils to help and advise people who have lost their homes or are in danger of doing so. Then there's the Committee stage of the completely uncontroversial Parking Places (Variation of Charges) Bill - which gives local authorities more flexibility over parking charges.\nAnd finally there's a Second Reading debate on the Political Parties (Funding and Expenditure) private members' Bill [HL] from the Lib Dem, Lord Tyler.\nJust as the Lib Dems overtook Labour in donations for the first time ever in the final quarter of 2016, his Bill would gradually take down the maximum amount a political party can accept from any one person in a year to \u00c2\u00a310,000 by 2026.", "label": 0.0, "predicted": 0.4125562608242035}, "373": {"text": "The 34-year-old was in intensive care in a Swiss hospital and an MRI scan detected bleeding on the brain.\nHis mount Boomerang Bob was brought down and fatally injured in the race.\nThe Injured Jockeys Fund said: \"In due course George will leave the intensive care area to the rehabilitation wing of the Wellington Hospital.\"", "label": 0.0, "predicted": 0.14823324978351593}, "374": {"text": "Mosimane said they could only blame themselves for not capitalising on a quick start in Atteridgeville, just outside Pretoria, where they were 2-0 up after just six minutes as their Ugandan visitors seemed to suffer from stage fright.\nWe have ourselves to blame for putting ourselves in this position so we need to take ourselves out of this position\nSundowns had the lion's share of possession in the first leg of their last 32-tie after that, but still allowed KCCA to get back into the game and net a potentially vital away goal in the 69th minute.\n\"We have ourselves to blame for putting ourselves in this position so we need to take ourselves out of this position.

Its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities, as well as financial hubs across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nBut it almost didn't get off the ground.\nWhen Mr Choe was appointed to launch and lead the company, Asia was booming; the tiger economies of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were expanding rapidly.\nBut as Frasers prepared to open its first two properties in Singapore, the Asian financial crisis hit.\nIt was 1997. Currencies went into freefall. Suddenly, people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling.\nMr Choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm, because when the properties opened they might not get paid.\n\"It was really that serious,\" he says. \"I remember tearing up because they said 'let's open it, let's open it whether you can pay us or not'.\"\nSurvival, Mr Choe admits, came through a bit of luck, and the misfortune of others.\nHe had convinced the board at parent firm, property group Frasers Centrepoint, to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in Singapore was easier.\nBut he also sensed it was a big, untapped market. And at the time of the crisis, it proved to be exactly what customers wanted.\n\"As we were going through this difficult patch, there were protests and riots in Jakarta,\" he says. \"A lot of companies like Microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of Jakarta.\"\nFrasers' 412 apartments were quickly in demand. Occupancy soon hit 70%, and then 90%.\nExplaining the popularity of serviced apartments, Mr Choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days, they happily stay in hotels, but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months, the walls of hotel rooms \"close in on you\".\nBut now, Mr Choe, 57, faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of Airbnb.\n\"The way to tackle Airbnb is not to ignore it. I will never underestimate Airbnb,\" he says.\nThere's been no significant impact on Frasers yet. Big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments, he says, because they can guarantee a level of safety and security. But that is likely to change, Mr Choe admits.\n\"I have two daughters who to my chagrin use Airbnb,\" he says. \"We took a family trip to Florence and I stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel, but paid a bundle for it.\n\"When my daughter joined us, she said, 'I'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros'. We paid about 330 euros.\n\"I asked why they stayed at Airbnb. They say 'it's like a surprise, it's part of the adventure'.\"\nAnd so now, Mr Choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to Frasers.\nWhile neutral colours, beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments, many customers want something different, and this is shaping Fraser's strategy.\nIn 2015 it bought Malmaison Hotel du Vin, a UK hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels.\nThat has taken them beyond financial centres, including to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Or, an intrepid traveller with $500 (\u00c2\u00a3325) to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in Oxford.\nAnd Frasers has launched the Capri sub-brand - whose website promises \"inspiring art and inspirational tech\".\nOn a day-to-day basis Mr Choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man, who - having been given a scholarship by the Shangri-La hotel group to study at Cornell University in the US - came back to Asia to learn about the hospitality industry.\n\"They put me in every department conceivable. I remember one of the toughest jobs I had was in the butchery. I had to carve an entire cow. For one month, I could not eat meat.\n\"I'm thankful for those experiences. When you step into a hotel, you immediately pick up what works and what doesn't work.\n\"When I see the check-in staff walking more than three steps, I know the counter is set up wrong.\n\"It's like a cockpit. Can you imagine if the pilot had to turn around when he flies?\"\nMore The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:\nThe 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich\nThe snacks boss with an appetite for success\nTaking his own path: The world's leading maze designer\nMr Choe adds that loyalty is very important to him, and he remains tremendously grateful to staff who have stayed with him.\n\"I will always respect and remember those who gave up their jobs to join me,\" he says.\nThis loyalty is something that Mr Choe has earned, according to Donald MacLaurin, associate professor at Singapore Institute of Technology, and specialist in the hospitality sector.\nMr MacLaurin points out that Mr Choe introduced a five-day working week, in a part of the world where six days is common, thereby showing \"a focus on quality of life issues for employees\".\nThe associate professor adds says the early success of the business was remarkable given the timing of its launch.\nFast forward to today and the company is now on track to operate 30,000 serviced apartments globally by 2019.
